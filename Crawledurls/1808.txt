<p><strong><a name="ACCREDITATION"></a>ACCREDITATION  </strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="q1"></a>What is  accreditation?</strong>   Accreditation  is intended to assure constituents and the public of the quality and integrity  of higher education institutions  and programs, and to help those institutions and programs improve. These  outcomes are achieved through rigorous internal and external review processes  during which the institution is evaluated against a common set of standards. </p>
<p>When  accreditation is awarded to an institution of higher education by the Southern  Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), a  regional accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of  Education, it means that the institution has (1) a mission appropriate to  higher education, (2) resources, programs, and services sufficient to  accomplish and sustain its mission, (3) clearly specified educational  objectives that are consistent with its mission and appropriate to the degrees  it offers, and that it is (4) successful in assessing its achievement of these  objectives and demonstrating improvements<strong>.  </strong>Accreditation by SACSCOC is a statement  of the institution&rsquo;s continuing commitment to integrity and its capacity to  provide effective programs and services based on agreed-upon accreditation  standards.</p>
<p><strong><a name="q2"></a>How can  I determine if an institution is accredited by the Southern Association of  Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)?</strong>  For a listing of institutions accredited by SACSCOC please see <u><a href="pdf/webmemlist.pdf">Accredited, Candidate, and Applicant Institution List</a></u>.  </p>
<p><strong><a name="q3"></a>Are branch campuses, online  programs, distance learning programs, and instructional sites included in the  grant of accreditation to an institution by the Southern Association of  Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)?</strong>  The  Commission accredits the entire institution, including reported branch  campuses, online programs, distance learning programs, and instructional  sites. Please see <u><a href="pdf/webmemlist.pdf">Accredited, Candidate, and Applicant Institution List</a></u>.  Branch campus information is currently being  updated; to find out about branches not listed, contact the office of the  SACSCOC staff member assigned to the institution.  </p>
<p><strong><a name="q4"></a>What is the difference between  regional, national and specialized accreditation?</strong>  Regional accrediting bodies conduct comprehensive reviews of  institutions of higher education and operate primarily in a specific  geographical area. The accreditation granted encompasses the entire  institution including reported branch campuses, other instructional sites, online  programs, and distance learning modalities.  Regional accrediting bodies typically accredit  a wide range of institutions offering associate, baccalaureate, masters and/or  doctoral degrees. </p>
<p>There are seven regional accrediting associations in the United States  comprising eight commissions that grant institution-wide accreditation. (For a  list of regional accrediting agencies, please see <a href="http://www.chea.org/">www.chea.org</a>.) While there are some modest differences in accreditation  standards across regions, they operate similarly and all are recognized by the  United States Department of Education (U.S.D.E.) to conduct accreditation  activities.  Regional accrediting bodies  also serve a &ldquo;gate keeper&rdquo; function for access to Title IV funds. The  primary service area for the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission  on Colleges (SACSCOC) includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia,  Kentucky, Louisiana,  Mississippi, North   Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Latin America.   SACSCOC does accept applications from  international institutions that can meet its accreditation standards.</p>
<p>National accrediting bodies conduct comprehensive reviews of  institutions and operate primarily throughout the United States. The  accreditation granted encompasses the entire institution. Most of the  accredited institutions are private and have missions focused either on career  education or religious education.  (For a  list of career and faith-based accrediting agencies functioning nationally and  recognized by the U.S.D.E., please see <a href="http://www.chea.org/">www.chea.org</a>.) </p>
<p>Specialized or programmatic accrediting bodies conduct focused  reviews of a single educational program and operate primarily throughout the  United States, although a few operate internationally. Many are recognized  by the U.S.D.E. to conduct accreditation activities. (For a list of  specialized accrediting agencies, please see <a href="http://www.chea.org/">www.chea.org</a>.) </p>
<p><strong><a name="q5"></a>Where  can I find the accreditation standards and policies of the Southern Association  of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges?</strong>  For accreditation standards, please see <em><u><a href="principles.asp">The  Principles of Accreditation: Foundations  for Quality Enhancement</a></u></em><u>.</u>   For policies, please see <u><a href="policies.asp">Policies, Guidelines, Good  Practices and Position Statements</a></u> and then select from the  array of policies that are listed in alphabetical order by title. </p>
<p><strong><a name="q6"></a>How does an institution become accredited by the Southern  Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges?</strong>   Please see <u><a href="cocapplication1.asp">Application Information</a></u>.  </p>
<p><strong><a name="q7"></a>What  standards must an institution meet in order to gain or maintain accreditation  by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges  (SACSCOC)?</strong>  Institutions accredited by SACSCOC must demonstrate  compliance with the standards for accreditation as contained in <em><u><a href="principles.asp">The  Principles of Accreditation: Foundations  for Quality Enhancement</a></u></em>, and with the policies and procedures of the Commission. (For  additional information about policies and procedures, please see <u><a href="policies.asp">Policies, Guidelines, Good  Practices and Position Statements</a></u>, and then select from the array of available documents that are listed  in alphabetical order by title.) </p>
<p><strong><a name="q8"></a>What  happens if an accredited institution doesn&rsquo;t meet accreditation standards?</strong>  Institutions that do not demonstrate that they meet  accreditation standards may be asked for monitoring reports, placed on the  public sanctions of &ldquo;Warning&rdquo; or &ldquo;Probation,&rdquo; or dropped from status as a  candidate or an accredited institution. (For additional information,  please see <u><a href="pdf/081705/sanction%20policy.pdf">Sanctions, Denial of  Reaffirmation, and Removal from Membership</a></u><a href="pdf/081705/sanction%20policy.pdf">.</a>) </p>
<p><strong><a name="q9"></a>How can I determine if there are any  accredited institutions currently on the public sanction of &ldquo;Warning&rdquo; or &ldquo;Probation&rdquo;?</strong>   For a list of  any institutions on &ldquo;Warning&rdquo; or &ldquo;Probation,&rdquo; please see <u><a href="accreditationDisclosure.asp">Accreditation  Actions &amp; Disclosure Statements</a></u>, and then select from the array of available documents.</p>
<p><strong><a name="q10"></a>What do &ldquo;Warning&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Probation&rdquo; mean?</strong>  For a description of &ldquo;Warning&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Probation,&rdquo; please see <u><a href="pdf/081705/sanction%20policy.pdf">Sanctions, Denial of  Reaffirmation, and Removal from Membership</a></u>.</p>
<p><strong><a name="q11"></a>Does the  Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)  accredit online institutions? </strong> SACSCOC has not yet accredited an  institution that delivers all its programs online.  There are many SACSCOC-accredited  institutions that use
  both traditional face-to-face and distance   learning/online modalities for delivering instruction. Many of   these institutions also   offer some individual programs   totally online.  Check with your institution of choice regarding online classes   or programs. </p>
<p><strong></strong><strong><a name="COMPLAINTS"></a>COMPLAINTS</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="q12"></a>How can I file a complaint  against an institution accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and  Schools  Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)?</strong>  Complete the Commission&rsquo;s Complaint Form and send two print  copies to the President, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission  on Colleges, 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur,   GA 30033-4097.  (To access the Commission&rsquo;s complaint policy, procedures, and the Complaint Form,  please see <u><a href="pdf/081705/complaintpolicy.pdf">Complaint Procedures Against the Commission  or Its Accredited Institutions</a></u>.) </p>
<p>Please read the document  carefully before submitting a complaint. Note that the  complaint policy only addresses significant, documented, alleged non-compliance  with the SACSCOC accreditation standards, policies or procedures.  Complainants are expected to have attempted to resolve the issue through the  institution&rsquo;s complaint processes before filing a complaint with SACSCOC.  The SACSCOC complaint process is not intended to be used to involve the  Commission in disputes between individuals and member institutions or to cause  the Commission to interpose itself as a reviewing authority in individual  matters; nor does the policy allow the Commission to seek redress on an  individual&rsquo;s behalf. The primary purpose of the SACSCOC complaint  procedure is to acquire valuable information regarding an accredited  institution&rsquo;s possible non-compliance with accreditation standards, policies  and procedures rather than to resolve individual disputes.  Complaints must be tied to specific standard  numbers from <em><u><a href="principles.asp">The  Principles of Accreditation: Foundations  for Quality Enhancement</a></u></em>.  </p>
<p><strong><a name="EVALUATION"></a>EVALUATION COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP</strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="q13"></a>How do I get on an evaluation committee?  </strong>For information on becoming an evaluator  for the Commission, please see <u><a href="pdf/commres/How%20to%20Become%20an%20Evaluator.pdf">How to Become an Evaluator</a></u>.  </p>
<p><strong><a name="FACULTY"></a>FACULTY QUALIFICATIONS </strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="q14"></a>How can I teach in a member  institution?</strong><strong>  </strong>Hiring decisions are the purview of the  institution where you would like to teach.   For information on hiring requirements at a particular institution,  contact the institution.  The Commission  neither evaluates individuals, résumés, or transcripts, nor does it certify  individuals.  </p>
<p>Institutions are required to document and justify that each faculty  member is qualified to teach assigned courses.   Documentation and justification may be accomplished by using only  traditional academic credentials, by using a combination of traditional  academic credentials and &ldquo;other&rdquo; qualifications, or by using only &ldquo;other&rdquo;  qualifications consistent with Comprehensive Standard 3.7.1, and reporting  these on the Commission&rsquo;s faculty roster form.   In essence, the institution is called upon to &ldquo;make its case&rdquo; for why  the faculty member is qualified to teach courses assigned.</p>
<p>If the traditional academic credential approach is used, then following  the <u><a href="pdf/081705/faculty%20credentials.pdf">Faculty Credential</a></u> guidelines will prove very helpful. When the qualifying credential aligns with  the courses being taught, no justification is normally required as the  credential speaks for itself, e.g. Ph.D. in English teaching English.  However, if the Ph.D. is in Business  Administration and the faculty member is teaching Accounting, then a written  justification is normally necessary.  </p>
<p>If a combination of traditional credentials and &ldquo;other&rdquo; credentials  is used, or if the &ldquo;other&rdquo; qualifications only approach is used, then a  portfolio approach for qualifications is suggested.  This approach normally requires a careful and  thorough justification that demonstrates the linkage between the various  components of the portfolio of qualifications to the courses being taught.  </p>

<p><strong><a name="q15"></a>How does an institution become  accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on  Colleges?</strong>  Please see <u><a href="cocapplication1.asp">Application  Information</a></u>. </p>
<p><strong><a name="q16"></a>What  standards must an institution meet in order to gain or maintain accreditation?</strong> Institutions accredited by the Southern  Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges must demonstrate  compliance with the standards for accreditation as contained in the <em><u><a href="principles.asp">The  Principles of Accreditation: Foundations  for Quality Enhancement</a></u></em><u>,</u> and with the policies and procedures of the Commission.(For  additional information about policies and procedures, please see <a href="policies.asp"><u>Policies, Guidelines, Good  Practices</u> <u>and Position Statements</u></a>, and then select from the array of available documents that are listed  in alphabetical order by title.) </p>
<p><strong></strong><strong><a name="SUBSTANTIVE"></a>SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE  </strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="q17"></a>What is a substantive  change and how should it be handled?</strong>  Substantive change is a significant modification or expansion of the  nature and scope of an accredited institution. For the types of  substantive change and the procedures for addressing them appropriately, please  see <u><a href="SubstantiveChange.asp">Substantive Changes</a></u>. </p>
<p><strong></strong><strong><a name="TRANSCRIPTS"></a>TRANSCRIPTS</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><a name="q18"></a>The Commission on Colleges does not have access to  transcripts.  Transcripts should be  obtained from the institution where the classes were taken or from which the  degree was awarded.  If the institution  has closed, contact the Department of Education for the state where the  institution was located for information on how to obtain transcripts.  </p>
<p><strong><a name="TRANSFER"></a>TRANSFER OF CREDITS</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="q19"></a>Will my credits transfer or  enable me to attend graduate school?</strong>  The acceptance of transfer credit is the responsibility of the  receiving institution and/or graduate school. Students should check with  potential receiving institutions and/or graduate schools well in advance to  determine the answer to this question.</p>
<p>The accreditation standards of this Commission require accredited  institutions to analyze credit accepted for transfer in terms of level,  content, quality, comparability and degree-program relevance. The  Commission&rsquo;s accreditation standards do not mandate that institutions accept  transfer credit only from regionally accredited institutions. (For more  information, please see
  <a href="pdf/JointDualAwards.pdf">Collaborative Academic Arrangements: Policy and Procedures</a>) </p>
<p><strong><a name="TRANSFER"></a> DEGREE MILLS AND ACCREDITATION MILLS </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="q20"></a></strong>The Council for Higher Education Accreditation has  information on its website addressing degree mills and accreditation  mills.  You can access <a href="http://www.chea.org">http://www.chea.org</a> to learn more about these  organizations and their representation.</p>
