<p>Although UNT makes every effort to keep costs low, many students still need help paying for college. The Student Financial Aid and Scholarships office annually awards $330 million in financial aid, including more than $39 million in scholarships.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="http://fafsa.gov/">Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA</a>, is an application that helps colleges and universities determine your eligibility for financial aid. In fact, nearly all students who complete the FAFSA receive some type of financial assistance.</p>
<p>Financial aid awards are funded and regulated by federal and state governments, so applying for and receiving financial aid is a process. The information and advice in this guide will help you get started. Then, by planning ahead, applying early and following the necessary steps, you will be able to meet your goal.</p>
<p>We’re here to help you. For more information, call us at 940-565-2302 or drop by the Student Financial Aid and Scholarships office on the first and second floors of the Eagle Student Services Center. See <a href="http://maps.unt.edu/places/1017/view">map</a>.</p>

<h3>When I complete the FAFSA, will I be applying for scholarships?</h3>
<p>No. Applying for scholarships is separate. However, many scholarships could require you to complete the FAFSA. For information about scholarships, visit our <a href="overview-scholarship-process">scholarships page</a> or contact the academic department that corresponds to your major.</p>

<div class="inner">
<p><strong><em>Take Note!</em></strong><em>&nbsp;<br /></em><em>You must apply for financial aid each year. Changes in federal regulations, educational costs and your family circumstances make it necessary to evaluate your eligibility annually.

<h3>What types of financial aid are available?</h3>
<p><strong>Grants: </strong>A <a href="grants">grant</a> is a type of <a class="glossary-term" href="/glossary/term/110"><span hovertip=110>need-based</span></a><span class="hovertip" id="110">Financial aid that is need-based depends on your financial situation. Most government sources of financial aid are need-based.</span> aid that does not have to be repaid. Your <a class="glossary-term" href="/glossary/term/108"><span hovertip=108>financial need</span></a><span class="hovertip" id="108">The difference between the COA and the EFC is the student's financial need - the gap between the cost of attending the school and the student's resources. The financial aid package is based on the amount of financial need. The process of determining a student's need is known as need analysis.</span> is determined by the FAFSA. Many federal, state and institutional grants are available at UNT.</p>
<p><strong>Work-study:</strong> <a href="work-study">Work-study jobs</a> are partially funded by the state or federal government. Your eligibility for the work-study program is determined by financial need. Work-study students work from 10 to 20 hours per week on campus and receive an hourly wage. A typical award is up to $4,000 per nine-month academic period. Students who are not eligible for work-study may seek employment on campus by visiting the <a href="http://studentaffairs.unt.edu/career-center">Career Center’s website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Loans: </strong><a href="loans">Loans</a> are available at low interest rates to students and parents of <a class="glossary-term" href="/glossary/term/41"><span hovertip=41>dependent</span></a><span class="hovertip" id="41">See Dependency Status.</span> students and must be repaid after you graduate or drop below half-time status. Some loans are based on financial need and others are available regardless of your financial circumstances. Several loan programs are available at UNT.</p>
<h3>Tuition rate plans and financial aid eligibility</h3>
<p>For new students, UNT offers two tuition plan choices to give you flexibility and convenience, the <a href="http://eagleexpress.unt.edu">Eagle Express plan and the Traditional plan</a>. You are eligible to receive financial aid and/or scholarships no matter which tuition plan you choose.</p>
<h3>How is financial need determined?</h3>
<p><img style="float: right; border: 1px solid black; margin: 11px 0 11px 11px;" src="/sites/default/files/10_099_stock_02.jpg" alt="Student graduation" /></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education determines your<br /><a class="glossary-term" href="/glossary/term/59"><span hovertip=59>Expected Family Contribution</span></a><span class="hovertip" id="59">The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is the amount of money that the family is expected to be able to contribute toward the student's education as determined by the Federal Methodology need analysis formula. The EFC includes the parent contribution and the student contribution, and depends on the student's dependency status, family size, number of family members in school, taxable and nontaxable income, and assets. The difference between the COA and the EFC is the student's financial need, and is used in determining the student's eligibility for need-based financial aid. If there are unusual financial circumstances, such as high medical expenses, loss of employment, or death of a parent, that may affect your ability to pay for your education, the student needs to tell their financial aid administrator (FAA). He or she can adjust the COA or EFC to compensate.</span> (EFC) based on information<br />you provide on the FAFSA. Parent and student resources are<br />considered the first source of funds to finance an education.<br />Financial aid is intended to supplement, not replace, family<br />resources. The primary responsibility of funding rests with<br />families and students. Parents’ income is not included in the<br />EFC for an <a class="glossary-term" href="/glossary/term/90"><span hovertip=90>independent student</span></a><span class="hovertip" id="90">See Dependency Status</span>.</p>

<h4>Special circumstances</h4>
<p>Representatives in the Student Financial Aid and Scholarships office can use <a class="glossary-term" href="/glossary/term/125"><span hovertip=125>professional judgment</span></a><span class="hovertip" id="125">For need-based federal aid programs, the financial aid counselor (or administrator) can adjust the EFC, adjust the COA, or change the dependency status (with documentation) when extenuating circumstances exist. For example, if a parent becomes unemployed, disabled, or deceased, the FAA can decide to use estimated income information for the award year instead of the actual income figures from the base year. This delegation of authority from the federal government to the financial aid counselor or administrator is called Professional Judgment (PJ).</span> and take special circumstances into consideration as decisions are being made about financial aid award packages. Examples of situations that are considered to be “special circumstances” include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loss or reduction of employment, wages, or unemployment compensation</li>
<li>Loss of <a class="glossary-term" href="/glossary/term/161"><span hovertip=161>untaxed income</span></a><span class="hovertip" id="161">Contributions to IRAs, Keoghs, tax-sheltered annuities, and 401k plans, as well as worker's compensation and welfare benefits.</span> or benefits, such as Social Security or child support</li>
<li>Separation or divorce</li>
<li>Loss of a parent or spouse</li>
<li>Unusually high medical expenses</li>

The SAR will also indicate Pell Grant eligibility, if any, and the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The student will receive a copy of your SAR four to six weeks after the FAFSA has been filed. The student should review the SAR and correct any errors on part 2. If the Processor was able to calculate an EFC, the student will be able to submit the SAR to the FAO for corrections (in most cases). If an EFC was not calculated, the student will need to send the corrections to the Processor. It is advised that the student keep a photocopy of the SAR for their records. To request a duplicate copy of a SAR, the student would need to call 1-800-433-3243.</span>. If you feel corrections are necessary, contact Student Financial Aid and Scholarships. If your SAR is accurate, keep it for your records.</p>
<p>Student Financial Aid and Scholarships will notify you at <a href="https://my.unt.edu">my.unt.edu</a> with additional instructions. It is important that you respond to all requests for additional information in a timely manner. Your file must be complete and you must be admitted to UNT before processing of aid can continue. Again, applying for and receiving financial aid is a process.</p>
<p>You may access your financial aid information at <a href="http://my.unt.edu">my.unt.edu</a><em>. </em>The amount of your financial aid award will be posted on myUNT, where you can accept, decline or reduce each award.</p>

<p>Financing your college education requires budgeting and careful planning for you and perhaps for your parents. Although our costs are kept low at the University of North Texas because of state assistance, many students still need help financing their education.</p>
<p>Financial aid makes it possible for thousands of students to attend UNT. The Student Financial Aid and Scholarships office annually awards $285 million in financial aid, including more than $22 million in scholarships. About 72 percent of our students receive financial aid and scholarships. In fact, nearly all students who complete the <a class="glossary-term" href="/glossary/term/73"><span hovertip=73>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</span></a><span class="hovertip" id="73">The FAFSA is used to apply for Pell Grants and all other aid. Complete your FAFSA via web at www.fafsa.gov . As the name suggests, no fee is charged to file a FAFSA. Follow the directions carefully to ensure proper and efficient processing.</span> can receive some type of financial assistance.</p>
