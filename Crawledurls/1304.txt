<h3>Apogee Stadium Seating Chart</h3>
<p>The <a class="mainlink" href="http://www.meangreenmap.com/apogeeseating.html" target="_blank">Apogee Stadium Interactive Seating Chart</a> allows fans to not only see prices of seats throughout the stadium, but to see the view from every section.</p>

<h3>Apogee Stadium</h3>
<p>The North Texas football team plays its home games at Apogee Stadium, located at the corner of I-35E and Bonnie Brae Street.</p>
<div class="osterman-apogee">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Opened in 2011, Apogee Stadium was designed by the same team that created the spectacular Dallas Cowboys Stadium. It features two huge, state-of-the-art video boards, 21 luxury suites, 750 club seats, high-tech facilities for broadcast and print media, banquet rooms and an 1,800-square-foot team apparel store. The stadium seats 30,850 in a horseshoe-shaped bowl, putting fans close to the action and offering excellent sight lines from every seat. <a class="mainlink" href="http://www.meangreenmap.com/apogeestadium.html" target="_blank">Click here for more information on Apogee Stadium</a>.</p>

<h3>Apogee Stadium Parking</h3>
<p>Three parking areas are available to fans on game day at Apogee Stadium: on the west and north sides of the stadium (Green Lot), east of Apogee and nearby Victory Hall (Red/Blue Lot), and at Fouts Field (Orange and ADA Lots).</p>
<p>The Green, Red, and Blue Lots are for Mean Green Club members with a parking pass designated for the lot assigned to the member according to the Mean Green Priority Point System. The Orange Lot is a cash lot open to the general public at a cost of $10 per parking spot. From this lot, fans can easily access Apogee Stadium via the Pedestrian Bridge across 35E.</p>
<p>The ADA Lot, located in the southwest end of the Fouts Field lot, is available for handicapped fans on a first-come, first-served basis. Shuttle buses run from the ADA Lot to Apogee before games, return fans to the lot after the game, and are available to for those needing ADA assistance and one additional accompanying person. Prior to the game, the buses will drop fans at Apogee Stadium's Gate 2 or, for those wishing to tailgate, at the northeast Victory Hall parking lot. After the game, the service will pick up only at Gate 2 and drop off at the ADA parking lot.</p>

<h3>Tailgating</h3>
<p>Tailgating is as much a tradition at Mean Green football games as any other university, and North Texas took tailgating into account when it constructed Apogee Stadium, setting aside an area just outside the stadium for students, fans and alumni to gather before games. It's called <a class="mainlink" href="http://www.meangreenmap.com/tailgating.html" target="_blank">The Hill</a>, a gentle rise dotted with trees lying just outside the east entrance to the stadium and north of the Victory Hall parking lot.</p>
<p>Tailgating takes place on the Hill, in all parking lots adjacent to Apogee Stadium, in the Fouts Field lot, and on the main campus before every home game. Campus parking lots open at 8 a.m. on game day.</p>
<p>To help tailgaters set up, tailgating equipment may dropped off in the parking area near Apogee Stadium on the southbound 35E service road, adjacent to The Hill. Entry will be from the 35E access road. This location will close approximately four hours prior to kick off and will reopen one hour after the end of the game.</p>
<p>Responsible and lawful consumption of alcohol is permitted within University rules and protocols. Glass containers and kegs are NOT permitted.</p>
<p>Tailgating activity that takes up vacant parking spaces or interferes with traffic flow within a parking lot is prohibited. Saving spaces for other vehicles is also prohibited. Tents, tarps, or canopies may not impede foot or vehicular traffic or extend into additional parking spaces. Ground stakes are prohibited in paved parking areas, and stakes used in the green space area may not be longer than 12 inches or wider than half an inch in order to not interfere with underground utilities. Weights or sandbags are encouraged.</p>
<p>Commercially-sponsored tailgates are prohibited except in designated locations. To organize such a tailgate, contact the sales department at 940-565-2527.</p>
<p>Fans from visiting teams are invited to join in the tailgating scene at Apogee. <a class="mainlink" href="http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ntex/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2014-15/misc_non_event/visitor-tailgate-guide.pdf" target="_blank">Click here for the Visitor's Tailgating Guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Mean Green March</h3>
<p>Two hours prior to kickoff, the North Texas football team arrives at Apogee Stadium, accompanied by the band, dancers, and cheerleaders. Be sure to greet the team and cheer them on as they march through the tailgating area to the stadium.</p>

<h3>Green Brigade Pregame Extravaganza</h3>
<p>Thirty minutes prior to kickoff, the North Texas Green Brigade band will perform on the Apogee Stadium field, leading up to the moment when the football team emerges from the lockerroom for the game.</p>

<h3>For Assistance At Apogee During Home Games</h3>
<p>During games at Apogee Stadium, fans requiring non-emergency assistance can send a text message and help will be dispatched. Text "SCRAPPY" along with the issue and your location to 69050 (message and data rates may apply). Fans may also call the non-emergency police dispatch at 940-565-3000. IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, CALL 911.</p>
