          <p>As many as <strong>1.5 million Americans</strong> live within the walls of autism, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <strong>One in 150 children</strong> is developmentally and emotionally challenged by the condition.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Research shows that almost <strong>half of children</strong> with autism who participate in <strong>early</strong>, <strong>intensive behavioral intervention</strong> (30 to 40 hours of weekly therapeutic interaction for two or three years between the ages of 3 and 5) <strong>become indistinguishable</strong> from other children and go on to live relatively normal lives without support or with minimal support.</p>
          <br />
          <p>UNT is home to the <strong>first graduate training program accredited by the <a href="http://www.abainternational.org/">Association of Behavior Analysis</a></strong>. Widely recognized as a pioneer in training behavior analysts, UNT's graduates help thousands of children each year. In fact, <strong>most board-certified behavior analysts</strong> in Texas are <strong>graduates of UNT's program</strong>.</p>
          <br />
          <p>UNT is sharing its research findings and intervention successes globally through its international research and training collaborations, online certification in <strong>Applied Behavior Analysis</strong> and participation in regional and international conferences.</p>
          <br />
          <p>The North Texas Autism Project is a <strong>service-learning</strong> project in UNT's <strong>Department of Behavior Analysis</strong>. The project was created in response to a growing local and national need for qualified providers of behavior analytic services. The project consists of:</p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Global learning community</strong><br>
              This project began in cooperation with the <strong>University of Stockholm</strong> and is a training program supporting professionals who provide high quality, evidence-based interventions to children with autism. Several countries will participate in the program and the model is being prepared for global availability. Evidence-based interventions have consistent scientific evidence showing that they improve client outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Community partnership programs</strong><br>
              By working with private providers, non profit organizations and government agencies, behavior analysis students experience learning through service to children with autism. The students and faculty work with groups that advocate for evidence-based autism programs and share their knowledge through workshops and distribution of research results locally and internationally.</li>
            <li><strong>The Family Connections Project</strong><br>
              The program addresses the needs of families with toddlers with autism. FCP teaches parents to look for or create opportunities to interact with their children in ways that will increase motivation and social responsiveness. By doing this, children learn increasingly complex skills through everyday family routines and activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Teaching Partners in Early and Intensive Behavioral Interventions Program</strong><br>
              The EIBI model is similar to that of a teaching hospital. The North Texas Autism Project director and senior-level masters and doctoral students demonstrate for and closely supervise trainees. Students are critiqued during individual intervention sessions with autistic children and attend weekly clinics with supervisors to review case data and participate in clinical decision making.</li>

          <p><a href="http://www.coe.unt.edu/care/fcp.htm">Family Connections Project</a></p>
          <br />
<p>The primary mission of the Family Connections Project is to enhance the quality of relationships within families who have children with autism. This is accomplished through a three pronged approach.  The first approach involves "functional communication training". Parents are taught techniques to help their children communicate throughout everyday family routines and activities. The second approach involves "planned activities training".  Parents are taught to identify key social routines and social opportunities throughout the day.  They then learn to create and capitalize on opportunities in ways that will enhance child skills and overall family life.  The final approach extends communication &amp; social activities support to siblings and extended family members, such as grandparents.</p>

<p><img src="images/press283.jpg" alt="See Sam Run book cover" width="90" height="134" hspace="2" align="left" />UNT alumnus Peggy Hinkle-Wolfe won the UNT Press Award during the 2005 Mayborn Literary Conference for her book proposal entitled "<em>Baby Book: A Mother's Memoir"</em>.</p>
<p>Her full book, <em>See Sam Run</em> is <a href="http://web3.unt.edu/untpress/catalog/detail.cfm?ID=283">available for purchase now</a>.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>In <em>See Sam Run</em>, Peggy  describes how her parenthood quickly descended into chaos  as her son, Sam, became uncommunicative and unmanageable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d grown to  hate making entries in his baby book,&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;The energy I had  before he was born, when I wrote paragraphs anticipating his arrival,  was gone now. Writing down Sam&rsquo;s barest achievements felt fraudulent.&rdquo;  Little by little, she found a new truth: that by learning to understand  the ugliness inside herself, she learned to love her new life and her  son, and to harness, at last, the energy needed to realize Sam&rsquo;s  fullest potential. </p>
