<h2>Lex Frieden Employment Awards</h2>

<h3>About the Awards</h3>

<p>The Governor&rsquo;s Committee on People with Disabilities is proud to announce that the annual employment awards have been renamed after disability rights champion and independent living movement leader Lex Frieden, one of the architects of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.</p>

<p><img alt="front and back of Lex Frieden medallion " src="http://gov.texas.gov/files/disabilities/LF_Medallion.JPG" style="float: right;" title="front and back of Lex Frieden medallion " /></p>

<p>Frieden is the UT Chancellor&#39;s Health Fellow on Disability, a professor of biomedical informatics and rehabilitation at UT Health and director of the Independent Living Research Utilization Program (ILRU) at TIRR Memorial Hermann Rehabilitation Hospital. He was appointed by President George W. Bush as chair of the National Council on Disability in 2002, and also served an eight-year term on the United Nations Panel of Experts on the Standard Rules for Disability. Frieden is author or co-author of more than 60 articles on independent living, disability rights and rehabilitation. He has received two Presidential Citations for his work in the field of disability, and was awarded an honorary doctorate in law by the National University of Ireland in 2004.</p>

<p>Since 1979, the Governor&#39;s Committee has worked to highlight the efforts of employers to hire and retain employees with disabilities, and to recognize Best Practices that positively affect employees with disabilities within the workplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;An employer whose philosophy is to support employment opportunities for all Texans, including people with disabilities, benefits the local community as well as the state. The attitude of working as a partner in the community is considered a strength to be highlighted and encouraged by the presentation of our annual Employment Awards.&nbsp;The active and enthusiastic promotion of business opportunities for people with disabilities is also an important element in the consideration of the award.</p>

<p>Each year during the month of October (National Disability Employment Awareness Month), a local committee in Texas hosts the Annual Employment Awards Ceremony, and the winners in each of several categories are introduced to an appreciative audience. Award categories include large, medium, and small employers, as well as non-profit employers, the Entrepreneurship Award, Martha Arbuckle Award and the Governor&rsquo;s Trophy.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.usbln.org/bln_tx_houston.html" target="_blank">Greater Houston Business Leadership Network: Business Symposium and Job Fair </a>(Houston)</strong><br />
In May 2015, the Greater Houston Business Leadership Network (GHBLN) planned and implemented a Business Symposium and Job Fair co-hosted by DARS, Office of Federal Contract and Compliance Program (OFCCP), Veterans Administration, and Workforce Solutions, held at the United Way Community Resource Center in Houston. The hiring event attracted more than 200 veterans, people with disabilities, and various employers seeking qualified applicants. Job seekers had an opportunity to interact with 54 federal contractors from many diverse industries. After the hiring event, employers participated in a business symposium with the purpose of exploring smart solutions for OFCCP compliance, recruiting top talent, and building a diverse workforce. The conference-style event included presentations from guest speakers on communicating the values, benefits, and rewards of hiring veterans and people with disabilities. Other organizations spoke on topics related to vocational rehabilitation and employment, and services available to businesses, including diversity and disability awareness services. The keynote speaker was Robert Shelton of the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC). Shelton spoke about a new initiative at the center, the No Boundaries Employee Resource Group, which promotes the development, inclusion, and innovation of JSC&#39;s workforce with a focus on employees with disabilities. To encourage other organizations to present similar Job Fairs and Business Symposiums, GHBLN created a guide which includes statewide and regional contact information, available upon request for any interested group.
