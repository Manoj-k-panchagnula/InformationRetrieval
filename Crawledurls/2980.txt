    <p>There are two construction updates for April and May that may affect UNT community members.</p>
<p>In late April, the 35Express project on Interstate 35E will begin demolition of the North Texas Boulevard bridge to make way for a new bridge. The timeline for this work includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Demolition starts at 9 p.m. April 29 (Friday) on the North Texas Boulevard bridge over I-35E. Traffic will be routed off of I-35E and onto the service roads while that work is being done.</li>
  <li>I-35E is scheduled to reopen at 6 a.m. May 2 (Monday). With the bridge gone, traffic on the frontage roads will not stop at the North Texas Boulevard intersection. Traffic coming from North Texas Boulevard will have designated turn lanes that will yield to the frontage roads.</li>
  <li>Three lanes of the new North Texas Boulevard bridge – one in each direction and a turning lane – are expected to be open in late summer.</li>
  <li>The full bridge – two lanes in each direction, two dedicated turning lanes, two U-turn lanes and a pedestrian walkway – is expected to be complete in the fall.</li>

    <p>In late May, the City of Denton will begin work on Eagle Drive. The timeline for this work includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Starting in late May, the city will begin reconstructing and re-striping Eagle Drive from North Texas Boulevard.</li>
  <li>The project will continue along Eagle Drive to Carroll Boulevard and is expected to last through fall. </li>
  <li>At least one lane in each direction will remain open throughout this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the work surrounding UNT, the university recommends that individuals coming to campus give themselves ample time for travel and consider the following alternative routes.</p>
<p>Since work on Eagle Drive won't yet be underway at the time of UNT's Commencement on May 13-14, it is recommended that visitors use Fort Worth Drive. For events in late May, once construction has started on Eagle Drive, extra travel time may be needed and using routes from Sycamore, Mulberry or Oak streets, or from Bonnie Brae should be considered.</p>
<p>During the bridge closure, traffic wishing to access North Texas Boulevard will use the following detours:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Southbound I-35E traffic will continue to the Fort Worth Drive exit, make a U-turn and continue on the northbound frontage road to North Texas Boulevard.</li>
  <li>Northbound I-35E traffic take the McCormick Street exit and continue on the northbound frontage road to North Texas Boulevard.</li>
  <li>UNT community members leaving campus are encouraged to avoid North Texas Boulevard and use alternate routes such as Eagle Drive to McCormick to reach south I-35E, or West Oak Street to reach south I-35W or north I-35.</li>

  	<p>As part of the I-35 E reconstruction, the Corinth Parkway Bridge is one of several bridges being reconfigured to run under I-35E and will include two lanes in each direction, a dedicated turn lane in each direction, a Texas U-Turn lane and pedestrian walkways on either side of the roadway.
</p>
<p>To prepare for this project, crews are widening the northbound I-35E main lanes to accommodate a traffic shift that will be in place after the bridge is demolished </p>
<p>The bridge is expected to be demolished early-to-mid October and construction is expected to last through fall 2015.</p>
<p>During construction, westbound Corinth Parkway traffic will be detoured to Post Oak Drive and back around to the southbound frontage road to westbound Corinth Parkway.</p>
<p>Eastbound Corinth Parkway traffic will be detoured south to the frontage road, make a U-Turn near the Destiny Dallas RV Resort Park and continue on the northbound frontage road to eastbound Corinth Parkway. </p>
<p>With the new bridge deck in place, the expanded center section of the Valley View Lane Bridge is almost complete. Work on the roadway approaching the bridge will continue through September. At Belt Line Road, work has begun on the columns for the new I-35E bridge.</p>
<p>At Whitlock Lane/Sandy Lake Road, work on the new center portion of the I-35E bridge is almost complete. Southbound traffic will shift east in September when asphalt paving is finished. Work on the west side of the bridge will begin soon after.</p>
<p>In Lewisville, the switch to the new temporary southbound frontage road between Garden Ridge Boulevard and FM 407 is now complete. The switch allows crews to start work on the main lane bridges being constructed over FM 407. Traffic will be routed to the temporary frontage road south of FM 407 next month.</p>
<p>On the Lewisville Lake Bridge, traffic has been moved to the east side of the structure so work on the west side can begin. Work continues on columns and the first cap is set to be poured this Friday, Aug. 29. The crane and rig are making progress on the drill shafts in the water.</p>
<p>North of the lake, construction crews have begun extensive work on the outside shoulder of I-35 from Corinth Parkway up to Loop 288. This effort will soon be replicated on the west side of the roadway.</p>
<p>At US 77, the removal of the deck for the existing northbound I-35E bridge is now complete and work has started on the span over the southbound entrance to I-35E. Finally, the deck for the southbound side of the Bonnie Brae Bridge is expected to be placed next month.</p>

  	<p>Looking for an easy way to get to work or school? Want some extra time to study, sleep or catch up on work? Consider the <a href="http://www.dcta.net/">Denton County Transportation Authority</a>'s <strong><a href="http://www.dcta.net/university-pass-program/educational-discount-tickets/menu-id-185.html">University Pass Program</a>,</strong> which offers reduced fares for University of North Texas students, faculty and staff on local and regional transportation systems.</p>
  	
  	<p>The program offers two levels of participation: the Local System and Regional System. The Local System Passes are valid on the <a href="http://www.dcta.net/routes-schedules/a-train-routes-a-schedules/menu-id-134.html">A-train</a>, Denton Connect, Connect RSVP and UNT Shuttles. The Regional System passes are valid on all of the local systems and fixed-route bus and rail services provided by the <a href="https://www.dart.org/">Dallas Area Rapid Transit</a>, <a href="http://www.trinityrailwayexpress.org/index.html">Trinity Railway Express</a> and the <a href="http://www.the-t.com/">Fort Worth Transportation Authority</a>.</p>
  	
  	<p>DCTA's A-train connects Denton and Dallas counties six days a week, making two stops in Denton and three in Lewisville and connecting to the <a href="https://www.dart.org/">Dallas Area Rapid Transit</a> system in Carrollton. The A-train takes 45 minutes to complete its entire route from the <a href="http://www.dcta.net/images/stories/pdfs/transportation/A-train/MP_DDTC-outlines.pdf">Downtown Denton</a> station to the <a href="http://www.dcta.net/images/stories/pdfs/transportation/A-train/TM.pdf">DART Trinity Mills</a> station. Operating from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, from 5 a.m. until past midnight on Friday and 9:30 a.m. until past midnight with limited frequencies on Saturday, the A-train's tracks run alongside Interstate 35 East.</p>
  	
  	<p>University Passes can be purchased in person at the Downtown Denton Transit Center (608 E. Hickory, Denton) or <a href="https://web3.unt.edu/trans/DCTA/verify.php">online</a> through UNT Parking and Transportation Services.</p>
  	
  	<p>If you do not live near a bus route or A-train stop, ridesharing may be a good alternative to driving every day. UNT Parking and Transportation Services offer a ridesharing program that is tailored to the UNT community. This service allows for people to search through a bank of people that are willing to drive or need rides, then communicate through anonymous emails to arrange rides and expenses.</p>
  	
  	<p>The ridesharing service can be accessed at the <strong><a href="http://www.unt.edu/transit/ridesharing.html">UNT Parking and Transportation website</a>.</strong></p>

    <p>Reconstruction of I-35E between U.S. Highway 380 in Denton south to Interstate 635 will begin in October. An official <strong>groundbreaking on</strong> <strong>Oct. 3</strong> will launch the four-year project, which includes 28 miles of I-35.</p>
    
    <p>The $4.8 billion project includes the addition of managed lanes, general purpose lanes, improvements to various bridges and a new southbound bridge over Lake Lewisville.</p>
    
    <p>Construction should begin in mid-October on the bridges at Bonnie Brae, U.S. Highway 77, Mayhill Road, McCormick Road, FM 407, Whitlock Lane, Crosby Road, Valwood Parkway, and Valley View Lane. Work on the Lake Lewisville bridge is expected to begin in November.</p>
    
    <p>In addition, the segment of I-35 that stretches from US 380 in Denton to Swisher Road or FM 2181 in Corinth will be expanded from four to six lanes. The bridges at North Texas Boulevard, Post Oak and Corinth Parkway also will be expanded. Turbeville Road will be connected to the north- and southbound I-35E frontage roads. Both frontage roads also will be rebuilt. This work is expected to take place in 2014.</p>
    
    <p>The Texas Department of Transportation also publishes <a href="http://ftp.dot.state.tx.us/pub/txdot-info/dal/i35e/35e_project_tracker.pdf">Project tracker</a>, a quarterly update on the project.</p>
