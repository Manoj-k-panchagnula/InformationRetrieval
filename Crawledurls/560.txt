	Congratulations to Garima Bajwa on winning the Toulouse Graduate Schoolâ€™s 
	Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition held on November 21st at UNT! In this competition, 
	nine graduate students had three minutes to explain their research and dissertation 
	to a general audience. Garima presented her thesis "Neuro-Sign: NOT Just another Vital Sign".
	<br><br>3MT is not an exercise in trivializing or â€™dumbing-downâ€™ research, but challenges 
	students to consolidate their ideas and research discoveries so they can be presented 
	concisely to a non-specialist audience. The first 3MT competition was held in Australia 
	at the University of Queensland in 2008. More than 200 universities worldwide 
	now host competitions, including 40 in the U.S.
	<br><br>
	Garima won the first prize of $3,000 and will represent UNT at the regional competition, 
	which is scheduled for the Southern Council of Graduate Schools annual conference in February. 
	She is a Ph.D. student of Dr. Ram Dantu.
