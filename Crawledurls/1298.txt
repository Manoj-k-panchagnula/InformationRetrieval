          $8.5 million by the U.S.
          Department of Defense.</p>
        <p><a href="http://physics.unt.edu/content/marco-buongiorno-nardelli-phd">Marco Buongiorno Nardelli</a>, professor of physics
          and chemistry and a fellow
          of the American Physical
          Society and the Institute of
          Physics, is one of the primary

        <h2>Plant Stress Defense</h2>
        <div class="caption_box_rt"> <img src="images/2014_NB-plant-stress.jpg" alt="scan shows a plant signaling distress over a 10-minute period" class="photo_bot" style="border-color: #C3D82F;" />
          <p>A scan shows a plant signaling distress over a 10-minute period. <strong>Ron Mittler</strong>, professor of biological sciences, studies signaling in plants.</p>
        </div>
        <p>How a plant identifies
          stress factors, such as heat,
          disease or toxins, and then
          spreads the signal to defend
          itself against those incoming
          stressors was the subject of
          a research study led by <a href="https://faculty.unt.edu/editprofile.php?pid=3477">Ron Mittler</a>, professor of biological
          sciences.</p>
        <p>It’s the first research to
          outline the importance of
          reactive oxygen species for signal
          production in plants. The
          oxygen-containing molecules
          propagate the stress signal
          throughout the plant tissue.</p>
        <p>Mittler also found that
          triggering a stress signal in a
          plant gave it time to prepare
          for worse conditions. For
          example, a plant blasted with
          a small amount of heat as a
          trigger to signal its defenses
          was able to survive longer
          heat exposure later.</p>
        <p>Plants exposed to long
          periods of heat with no time
          to prepare did not survive.</p>
        <p>“Now that we know we
          can trigger plants to prepare
          for situations like drought,
          intense heat or disease, we
          are one step closer to being
          able to save many crops
          that would otherwise die,”
          Mittler says.</p>
        <p>The research was published
          in <em>The Plant Cell</em> of the American Society
          of Plant Biologists in
          September 2013.</p>
        <p>Mittler worked on the
          project with <a href="http://biology.unt.edu/people/vladimir-shulaev">Vladimir Shulaev</a>, UNT professor
          of biological sciences, and

        <p>Many veterans suffer from
          tinnitus and hearing loss as a
          result of exposure to gunfire,
          explosions, airplane noise and
          other harsh sounds related to
          military service. The UNT
          <a href="http://speechandhearing.unt.edu/SPHS-clinic/tinnitus">Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Clinic</a> provides research, testing,
          counseling and treatment
          devices to help vets and others
          who suffer from this condition.
          Commonly known as
          “ringing in the ears,” tinnitus
          is caused by sensory and nerve
          damage to the inner ear.</p>
        <p>The clinic is among a
          few audiology clinics in the
          state that integrate treatment
          with cutting-edge,
          research-supported technology,
          says <a href="http://speechandhearing.unt.edu/people/faculty/moore">Ernest Moore</a>,
          chair of UNT’s <a href="http://speechandhearing.unt.edu/">Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences</a>. Patients have access
          to specialized equipment
          and procedures developed by
          faculty experts who pinpoint
          the nature of tinnitus and the
          frequency range in which the
          condition occurs.</p>
        <p><a href="http://speechandhearing.unt.edu/people/faculty/ward">Lana Ward</a>, supervising
          audiologist and coordinator
          of clinical audiology at the
          clinic, says tinnitus can be
          overwhelming and permanent
          but treatment options such
          as hearing devices that redirect
          the brain’s focus to different
          sounds can “essentially
          train the brain to live with
          the condition.”</p>
        <p>Making counseling and
          education essential treatment
          components along with hearing
          solutions sets the UNT
          clinic apart from others that
          concentrate mainly on hearing
          solutions only, Ward says.</p>

          matching gift from TruCare
          Solutions Inc., the AHP program
          is helping to increase the
          number of African American
          and Hispanic males who
          become licensed physical
          therapists. That demographic
          makes up less than 1 percent
          of the field, and the lack of
          diversity could lead to health
          disparities for ethnic minority
          populations, Keller says.</p>
        <p>Through the AHP program,
          direct transfer agreements
          accelerate the students’
          transition from the two-year

          the doctoral physical therapy
          program at the UNT Health

          Spanish-language training,

          professional internships
          and networking. More than
          50 African American and
          Hispanic males have entered
          the AHP program since it was
          created in 2012.</p>

        <p>Ten UNT <a href="https://music.unt.edu/">College of Music</a> students had a rare
          opportunity to prepare a
          new edition of a significant
          Baroque composition, which
          was performed in concert last
          fall by fellow students.</p>
        <p>The new edition of Claudio
          Monteverdi’s <em>Vespers</em>, or
          <em>Vespro della Beata Vergine</em>, of
          1610 was prepared by students
          of <a href="https://music.unt.edu/faculty-and-staff/detail/274">Hendrik Schulze</a>, assistant
          professor of music history.</p>
        <p>Prestigious music publisher
          Bärenreiter requested that
          Schulze edit the <em>Vespers</em>, 14
          movements for soloists, chorus
          and orchestra considered
          a master work that defines
          17th-century sacred music.</p>
        <p>Schulze enlisted the students
          to begin work on the
          edition in fall 2011 in a musicology
          course he created for
          the project. They transcribed
          the original source materials
          into modern notation and
          corrected inconsistencies as
          they deemed fit according to
          their research. The edition
          was published in April 2013.
          Proceeds support UNT musicology

        <p><a href="http://chemistry.unt.edu/people-node/guido-f-verbeck-iv">Guido Verbeck</a>, associate
          professor of chemistry,
          has partnered with Denton
          County to create the county’s
          first forensic drug lab. The
          lab will be housed on the
          UNT campus.</p>
        <p>As Denton County’s population
          is growing closer to 1
          million, the number of drug
          cases needing forensic testing
          also has increased. In the past,
          Denton County drug evidence
          was sent for testing to a
          lab in Garland. The Garland
          lab is one of the busiest crime
          labs in the area, which meant
          test results weren’t returned
          as quickly as needed.</p>
        <p>“With the high-tech equipment
          we have in the UNT
          Crime Lab, we will be able
          to analyze samples, pull drug
          evidence from fingerprints,
          and provide the services the
          county needs very quickly,”
          Verbeck says.</p>
        <p>The lab is working toward
          accreditation from the American
          Society of Crime Laboratory
          Directors/Laboratory
          Accreditation Board.</p>
        <p>Verbeck developed a
          device that allows investigators
          to manipulate samples
          on the nano-scale with mass
          spectrometry, getting more
          accurate findings and saving
          time and money.</p>

        <h2>Health Website</h2>
        <p>A website that adapts

          goal of a community health
          project led by communication
          design associate professors
          <a href="http://art.unt.edu/designresearchcenter/members/keith-owens">Keith Owens</a> and <a href="http://art.unt.edu/designresearchcenter/members/michael-gibson">Michael Gibson</a>. Owens and Gibson
          are research faculty associated
          with UNT’s <a href="http://art.unt.edu/designresearchcenter/">Design Research Center</a>, where teams of
          faculty, students and professionals
          use design to create
          practical solutions to complex
          problems.</p>
        <p>The center’s partners
          on the website project are
          the Denton County Health
          Department, Cook Children’s
          Hospital, the Denton ISD,
          Denton County MHMR
          and the Wellness Alliance for
          Total Children’s Health.</p>
        <p>The researchers created
          a prototype for the website,
          which asks visitors to enter
          basic information — age, sex,
          ZIP code and, if applicable,
          their diagnosis. They also
          indicate if they are a child,
          parent or guardian, healthcare
          professional, or childcare
          worker such as a teacher or
          counselor. The site then tailors
          information to the user.</p>
        <p>For example, for a middle
          school girl with an eating disorder,
          the site could display
          personal stories from others
          her age about how they overcame
          the disorder, as well as
          resources in her ZIP code
          area. The girl’s mother could
          find healthcare providers
          nearby and information on
          her daughter’s disorder.</p>
        <p>The site isn’t meant to
          diagnose illness, Gibson says,
          but to be a resource for children
          and families to find help.
          The researchers are working
          to secure additional funding
          for the project, which they
          hope to launch this fall.</p>

        <p>Digging through sediment
          layers can provide clues to a
          stormy past. <a href="http://geography.unt.edu/faculty/harry-williams">Harry Williams</a>,
          professor of geography, is
          studying evidence of ancient
          typhoons in Thailand to help
          determine how often they
          strike. Historical records of
          the storms only exist for the
          past 50 to 60 years.</p>
        <p>Williams first visited
          Thailand with funding from
          UNT’s Charn Uswachoke
          International Development
          Fund and then received a grant
          from the National Science
          Foundation’s Catalyzing
          New
          International Collaborations
          program to begin conducting
          the research with Montri
          Choowong,
          associate professor
          of geology at Chulalongkorn
          University, and UNT master’s
          student<strong> Eric Simon</strong>.</p>
        <p>The researchers dug
          through layers of sediments in
          tidal marshes south of Bangkok,
          where a layer of sand
          would indicate a past typhoon
          storm surge. Identifying and
          dating the layers allows them
          to construct a long-term
          record of typhoon strikes and
          determine the average number
          of years between major strikes.</p>
        <p>“The smaller the intervals
          are between storms, the more
          governments need to be
          prepared with mitigation measures,
          such as planning evacuation
          routes and educating the
          citizens,” Williams says. “If
          past disasters aren’t in most
          people’s recent memory, they
          may not be aware of possible
          storm surge threats or know
          how to prepare for them.”</p>
        <p>Williams also has studied
          ancient tsunamis in the Pacific
          Northwest and storm surge
          deposits in the U.S. left behind
          by hurricanes.</p>

        <p><a href="http://danceandtheatre.unt.edu/faculty-staff/dr-andrew-b-harris">Andrew B. Harris</a>, professor
          of theatre, premiered his
          play <em>The Lady Revealed</em> —
          focusing on British scholar
          A.L. Rowse and his claim that
          Emilia Bassano was the “Dark
          Lady” of Shakespeare’s sonnets
          — at UNT last spring.</p>
        <p>The play also was performed
          in a workshop
          production this March in
          collaboration with Theatre3,
          one of Dallas’ most prominent
          theatres.</p>
        <p>While researching another
          play he wrote years ago,
          Harris came upon Rowse’s
          work and became intrigued by
          the scholar and prolific writer
          who was controversial for his
          claims about the sonnets.</p>
        <p>Harris discovered Bassano’s
          relatives while researching
          the play in England
          through a Research and
          Creativity Enhancement
          award from UNT. Those
          relatives led Harris to Bassano
          relatives in Texas, who attended
          the UNT production.</p>
        <p>Associate professor of
          theatre <a href="http://danceandtheatre.unt.edu/faculty-staff/sally-vahle">Sally Vahle</a> directed

          in both productions and
          worked on lighting, sound,
          costume and set design.</p>
        <p>“The fact that the students
          are originating roles that
          have never been performed
          before,” Harris says, “gives
          them a valuable opportunity
          to truly start from scratch
          and place their mark upon
          the play as it evolves.” </p>

        <h2>Cardiomyopathy</h2>
        <p>UNT researchers have
          identified new compounds
          that may lead to drugs to treat
          forms of hereditary cardiomyopathy,
          a disease that weakens
          the heart and can lead to heart
          failure. The disease is the
          leading cause of sudden death
          in young athletes.</p>
        <p><strong>Alysha Joseph</strong> and <strong>Diana
          Wang</strong>, who were students
          at UNT’s <a href="https://tams.unt.edu/">Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science</a>,

        <p>Root, who has been
          researching cardiomyopathy
          and muscle contractile proteins
          for some time, says his
          research suggests that mutations
          make regions of proteins
          in the heart unstable.</p>
        <p>“The idea occurred to us to
          see what kinds of compounds
          would bind to the weakened
          region, stabilize it and counteract
          the destabilizing effect
          of the mutations,” he says.</p>
        <p>Joseph and Wang found
