The maximum level of support a student may apply for during the fall and spring semesters is $500. There is no interest or&nbsp;origination fee associated with this loan. Repayment of a loan and interest is the responsibility of the student and is required by the student to repay as defined by the terms stated in the promissory note. Application and loan processing dates vary with each semester. Students are limited to 1 loan per semester.</p>
