<h1>North Texas Students</h1>
<br>

<h3>Students Get In Free</h3>
<p>North Texas competes in 12 men's and women's sports, and admission to all Mean Green home sporting events is free to UNT students with a valid student ID.</p>

<h3>Football Student Tickets</h3>
<p>Mean Green students are encouraged to get their tickets early, and can do so for each home football game starting on Monday of home game weeks. Students must present their UNT student ID to pick up tickets at the North Texas Athletic Ticket Office located at Gate 2 of Apogee Stadium from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, or in the Library Mall near the Administration Building (look for the green North Texas tent) from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday. For more information, call 940-565-2527 or email to TicketOffice@unt.edu.</p>
<p>North Texas students can also pick up tickets on game day at the Gate 4 ticket window at Apogee Stadium beginning five hours before kickoff.</p>

<p>The <a class="mainlink" href="http://www.meangreenmap.com/apogeeseating.html" target="_blank">Apogee Stadium Interactive Seating Chart</a> allows fans to not only see prices of seats throughout the stadium, but to see the view from every section.</p>

<h3>Apogee Stadium</h3>
<p>The North Texas football team plays its home games at Apogee Stadium, located at the corner of I-35E and Bonnie Brae Street.</p>
<div class="osterman-apogee">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Opened in 2011, Apogee Stadium was designed by the same team that created the spectacular Dallas Cowboys Stadium. It features two huge, state-of-the-art video boards, 21 luxury suites, 750 club seats, high-tech facilities for broadcast and print media, banquet rooms and an 1,800-square-foot team apparel store. The stadium seats 30,850 in a horseshoe-shaped bowl, putting fans close to the action and offering excellent sight lines from every seat. <a class="mainlink" href="http://www.meangreenmap.com/apogeestadium.html" target="_blank">Click here for more information on Apogee Stadium</a>.</p>

<h3>Friday Night On The Hill</h3>
<p>Mean Green Friday night pep rallies are held on The Hill just east of Apogee Stadium. Fans are encouraged to come out early and save their spot for tailgating for the game the following day.</p>
<p>The night will be filled with live bands, DJs, competitions, free food, give-a-ways and apperances by athletes, coaches, cheerleaders, dancers, America's best marching band the Green Brigade, and Scrappy the Mean Green mascot. These events are open to the public.</p>

<h3>Football Tailgating</h3>
<p>Tailgating is as much a tradition at Mean Green football games as any other university, and North Texas took tailgating into account when it constructed Apogee Stadium, setting aside an area just outside the stadium for students, fans and alumni to gather before games. It's called <a class="mainlink" href="http://www.meangreenmap.com/tailgating.html" title="Tailgating On The Hill" target="_new">The Hill</a>, a gentle rise dotted with trees lying just outside the east entrance to the stadium and north of the Victory Hall parking lot.</p>
<p>Tailgating takes place on The Hill, in all parking lots adjacent to Apogee Stadium, in the Fouts Field lot, and on the main campus before every home game.</p>
<p>These items are permitted in the tailgating areas:</p>
<ul><li>Signage, Greek letters, banners, flags</li>
<li>Pop-up tents</li>
<li>Grills, smokers, etc.</li>
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Couches, chairs, etc.</li>
<li>Food and beverages</li>
<li>Coolers</li>
<li>Music</li></ul>
<p>These items are NOT permitted in the tailgating areas:</p>
<ul><li>Glass bottles</li>
<li>Kegs</li>
<li>Vehicles cannot be parked on sidewalks or grass</li></ul>
<p>Responsible and lawful consumption of alcohol is permitted within University rules and protocols. Glass containers and kegs are NOT permitted.</p>
<p>Tailgating activity that takes up vacant parking spaces or interferes with traffic flow within a parking lot is prohibited. Saving spaces for other vehicles is also prohibited. Tents, tarps, or canopies may not impede foot or vehicular traffic or extend into additional parking spaces. Ground stakes are prohibited in paved parking areas, and stakes used in the green space area may not be longer than 12 inches or wider than half an inch in order to not interfere with underground utilities. Weights or sandbags are encouraged.</p>
<p>Commercially-sponsored tailgates are prohibited except in designated locations. To organize such a tailgate, contact the sales department at 940-565-2527.</p>
<p>Fans from visiting teams are invited to join in the tailgating scene at Apogee. <a class="mainlink" href="http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ntex/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2014-15/misc_non_event/visitor-tailgate-guide.pdf" target="_blank">Click here for the Visitor's Tailgating Guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Friday Pre-Tailgating Equipment Drop-Off</h3>
<p>On Friday before each Saturday home game, students can drop off tailgating supplies at The Hill, located just east of Apogee Stadium near Victory Hall and Gate 4 of the stadium. Tents, couches, grills and all other tailgating necessities can be dropped off at the I-35 frontage road parking lot. Security is not provided in this area so items of value should not be left unattended. Drop off can also take place on game day until four hours prior to kickoff. At this time the service road is closed for pedestrian safety. The drop-off area will reopen one hour after the game for removal of your tailgating gear.</p>
<p class="artcenter"><img src="images/tailgate-dropoff.gif" width="588" height="250" alt="Tailgating Drop-Off Map"></p>

<h3>Mean Green March</h3>
<p>Two hours prior to kickoff, the North Texas football team arrives at Apogee Stadium, accompanied by the band, dancers, and cheerleaders. Be sure to greet the team and cheer them on as they march through the tailgating area to the stadium.</p>

<h3>Green Brigade Pregame Extravaganza</h3>
<p>Thirty minutes prior to kickoff, the North Texas Green Brigade band will perform on the Apogee Stadium field, leading up to the moment when the football team emerges from the lockerroom for the game.</p>

<h3>Items Prohibited At Apogee Stadium</h3>
<p>Bells, horns, whistles and other artificial noise makers are not permitted at Apogee Stadium per NCAA and Sun Belt Conference policies. Other prohibited items include but are not limited to: fireworks, weapons, flag poles, laser pointers, animals, explosive devices, artificial noise makers, outside food and drink (including tortillas), alcoholic beverages, hard-sided bags, suitcases, glass or metal beverage containers, flasks, coolers, thermoses, aerosol spray cans, umbrellas, video recorders and tripods.</p>

<h3>Banners and Signs</h3>
<p>Handheld banners, signs and flags are permitted that do not contain profanity or derogatory statements and do not obstruct the view of other spectators. No banners, signs or flags may be hung at Fouts Field without the prior approval of the Athletic Department.</p>

<h3>Road Football Game Tickets</h3>
<p>Current North Texas students can purchase up to two tickets to away games through the North Texas Athletic Ticket Office on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>

<h3>Basketball Student Tickets</h3>

<h3>The Pit Crew</h3>
<p>The Pit Crew is the official student section at North Texas home basketball games. There's a reason that North Texas has such a home-court advantage - because Mean Green students are loud and proud and give the Super Pit the reputation as being an intimidating place to play. </p>
<p>The Pit Crew assembles prior to each home game at the staging area on the Super Pit concourse at Gate B. Students are encouraged to get there as early as possible to get their Mean Green giveaways, cheer sheets, and newspapers to use for visiting team introductions. The Pit Crew staging area closes just after tip-off.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions/ideas/stories for the cheer sheet, send an e-mail to: AthMarketing@unt.edu.</p>

<h3>Road Basketball Game Tickets</h3>
<p>The North Texas Athletic Office does not offer tickets to men's or women's road basketball games. Students interested in attending away games should contact the host institution for tickets.</p>

<h3>Soccer, Softball and Volleyball Student Tickets</h3>
<p>North Texas students receive free admission to all home soccer, volleyball and softball games with their student ID.</p>
