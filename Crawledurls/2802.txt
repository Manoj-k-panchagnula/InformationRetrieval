<p><b>Academic Computing Services UNIX Host System Policies</b> </p>

<pre>Purpose: To summarize policies regulating the use of the ACS UNIX host systems
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by faculty, students and staff at the University of North Texas.

All individuals must comply with University computer resource policies and
standards. Academic Computing Services reserves the right to revoke access
to an ACS UNIX system account of any user who refuses to follow ACS UNIX
system account policies. Additionally, penalties for violation of the UNT
University-wide Computing Policy range from loss of computer resource usage
privileges to dismissal from the University, prosecution, and/or civil
action. It is your responsibility as an ACS UNIX Host System Account holder to
become familiar with UNT Computing Policies.

&nbsp;&nbsp; * Resource Utilization
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Use of servers
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Use of .rhosts file
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Use of Temporary Disk Space
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Reporting Violations

The policies listed in this document apply to use of the ACS UNIX Host Systems,
and are by no means a complete list of policies governing computer use at

        Policies</a></li>
</ul>

<pre>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resource Utilization

Programs that require more than 50% of the host system's processor
resources, or that run for a duration of more than ten minutes (sixty
minutes on restricted host systems), are considered &quot;computationally
intensive&quot; processes. A user is allowed to run only one computationally
intensive process for a total duration of 300 processor minutes. Processes
that exceed the limit will be terminated.&nbsp;

Programs that require more than 10% of real memory (20% on restricted host
systems) are considered &quot;memory intensive&quot; processes. Users are allowed to
run only one memory intensive process at any time. Type the command
/usr/ucb/ps -vx to examine the memory usage of your processes.

If you must run computational or memory intensive processes, please type
help at the shell prompt and read the guidelines for running such
processes.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of Servers

A server is a process that may provide resources to other users than
yourself. The other users may include users at UNT or on other computer
systems on the Internet. Servers of any kind, whether they be IRC &quot;bot&quot;
servers, MUD servers, game servers, or any other kind of server, are not
allowed on ACS UNIX Host systems.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of .rhosts File

The use of a &quot;+&quot; entry in a .rhosts file is prohibited on ACS UNIX Host
systems. If such a file is found in any account, the file will be removed,
and the account will be disabled. The Account Sharing Policy outlined in
the document University of North Texas Internet Policies, also applies to
the use of .rhosts files.

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of Temporary Disk Space

Do not save any files to /tmp. Files in /tmp will be deleted without
notice.

The /scratch partition has been provided for temporary disk space. It may
be used to upload/download files to and from the Internet to your ACS UNIX Host
account. /scratch is only for temporary use, and is not meant to be used as
an archive. Files placed on /scratch are deleted after three days. Backups
are not made of any of the files on /scratch; this anything lost or deleted
from this partition cannot be restored. Please read the file
/scratch/SCRATCH.POLICY for a detailed explanation of policies governing
the use of&nbsp; /scratch.

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reporting Violations

Violations or suspected violations of ACS UNIX Host system policies must be
reported at once to the UNT Computing Center Helpdesk (helpdesk@unt.edu) in
ISB 119 (565-2324).</pre>
