<h3>
	Section 9.14 - Amplified Sound &amp; Pianos</h3>

<p>
	Use of amplified sound is not allowed inside the University Union in open spaces, halls, or lounges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The maximum level of amplified sound for outdoors events is 92 decibels.&nbsp; Sound levels will be regulated by the building manager through the use of a hand-held sound level meter.</p>

<p>
	The University Union reserves the right to restrict access to the piano; ensuring use does not conflict with the daily business of the University Union.&nbsp; Pianists are expected to be courteous of others by monitoring their noise level and by responding promptly and politely when asked to cease playing.&nbsp; The piano cannot be relocated from its original location.</p>

<h3>
	Section 9.15 - Day Use Lockers</h3>

<p>
	Lockers are only accessible during University Union operational hours. &nbsp;The University Union provides both day locker and semester lockers, for a small fee. &nbsp;Students may check out a locker from the University Union Information Desk during operational hours.</p>

<p>
	To check out a locker, students must provide a current UNT ID and phone number.&nbsp;Items must be removed by 11pm on the day of check out. Items not removed by this time will be removed by University Union staff and submitted to the lost and found. Items not retrieved after one (1) week will be discarded or donated to charity. &nbsp;Nothing may be written, taped, painted, pasted, nailed, or otherwise affixed to the exterior or interior of the locker; stickers are prohibited.</p>

<p>
	Certain items are not allowed in the lockers. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Liquids, flammable chemicals or contents under pressure;</li>
	<li>
		Hazardous materials;</li>
	<li>
		Weapons;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Illegal substances or items that violate university policy;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Animals and other living creatures; and</li>
	<li>
		Food. Food may be stored ONLY if it is unopened, pre-packaged, and non-perishable.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If deemed necessary, the student will be charged for cleaning or damage. &nbsp;The University Union reserves the right to inspect lockers at any time without prior notification. &nbsp;Failure to follow regulations could result in a loss of the ability to check out a day locker.</p>
