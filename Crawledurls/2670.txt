<h3>Transition programs</h3>
<p>UNT wants to help your student make new
friends and adjust to college life from the
moment he or she steps foot on campus.
Some of the programs we offer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean Green Move-In, an annual event marking the opening of the residence halls</li>
<li>First Flight, UNT’s official welcome week program</li>
<li>Eagle Camp, an optional three-day experience for incoming students to make new friends and learn more about life at UNT</li>
<li>New Student Orientation, where students learn about campus resources and register for classes</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn more about these fun freshman programs at our <a href="http://transition.unt.edu">Orientation and Transition Programs site</a>.</p>
<h3>Activities</h3>
	<p>Students can choose from 400 organizations on campus; go to athletic events, concerts, plays and art exhibitions; attend lectures, film festivals and other cultural events; compete in recreational sports leagues; and work out in the Pohl Recreation Center. That’s one of the chief advantages of attending a large university like UNT &mdash; there’s something for everyone!</p>
		<p>One of the nation’s top 50 colleges graduating ethnic minority students, UNT works hard to create a welcoming environment and secure a reputation as a diverse institution. Many student organizations celebrate ethnic and racial heritage or support career networks such as the Hispanic Business Student Association and the National Association of Black Journalists. Learn more at the <a href="http://edo.unt.edu">Division of Equity and Diversity website</a>.</p>
<h3>From athletics to the arts</h3>
		<p>For many, intercollegiate athletics is essential to the university experience not only for your child, but for you! Conference USA football and 12 other men’s and women’s sports provide excitement and build affinity.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>With seating for 31,000 fans, UNT’s Apogee Stadium provides the ultimate game day experience. The Mean Green competes in Conference USA with Louisiana Tech, Rice and UT-San Antonio.</li>
        <li>About 1,000 concerts a year are presented by
UNT’s world-renowned College of Music.
Art exhibits, theatre and dance performances,
films and other activities also abound.</li>
		</ul>
        <h3>Campus security</h3>
		<p>UNT police patrol the campus 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, in vehicles, on bicycles and on foot. At night, the campus is well lighted, and students may ride the night shuttle, request pick up from e-ride
or call the UNT police for an escort, if needed.
Sixty-nine emergency phones located throughout campus provide direct access to the campus
police dispatcher at all times.</p>
		<p>Students should sign up for the <a href="http://unt.edu/eaglealert">Eagle Alert</a> system for information about campus closings and emergency situations affecting the safety and well-being of people on and around the campus. Voice and text messages
are sent to all students who have provided current contact information.</p>

<h3>Health care</h3>
		<p>UNT’s <a href="http://healthcenter.unt.edu">Health and Wellness Center</a> offers a full-service primary care clinic with licensed physicians, nurse practitioners and nurses to manage your student’s care and treatment. Our
licensed medical and support staff provides services
including:</p>
		<ul>
        <li>Basic diagnostic x-rays and lab testing</li>
		<li>Pharmacy</li>
		<li>Women’s care exams and education</li>
		<li>Immunizations and allergy injections</li>
		<li>College Optical Express, the first optical office
located on any college campus in the state of Texas</li>
<li>The UNT Dental Office, which opened in Spring 2015, provides dental services to the UNT community</li>
		</ul>
        <h3>Emotional support</h3>
		<p>Good grades aren’t everything. The emotional well-being
of your student is just as important as academic
success. UNT’s <a href="http://studentaffairs.unt.edu/counseling-testing-services">Counseling Center</a> offers professional
counseling, mental-health screenings, educational
programs and self-help resources.</p>
		<h3>Housing</h3>
		<p>UNT offers <a href="http://reslife.unt.edu">15 residence halls</a>, each with its own
study groups, advisors, social life and personality.
To meet the needs of our growing residence hall
community, an additional Honors College residence
called Rawlins Hall opened in Fall 2015.
Our living-learning communities, called REAL
communities, bring students together who share
the same major or interest. REAL communities
include engineering, jazz studies, business, art &amp;
design and sustainability. Freshmen who live
on campus make friends easier and have higher
GPAs than freshmen who live off campus.</p>
		<h3>Dining</h3>
		<p>Students can eat balanced meals at any of UNT’s
five residence hall cafeterias. Meal plans are available
and cafeterias are open at least 12 hours a day.
A staff dietitian is available to work with
students with food allergies or other needs.</p>
		<p>Our cafeterias provide many nutritious selections
including Mean Greens, a completely vegan dining
option, Champs which offers a wide selection of
freshly made pizzas and West Dining Hall, which
specializes in southern home-style cooking.
Learn more at the <a href="http://dining.unt.edu">Dining Services website</a>.</p>
		<p>UNT Dining serves 2.2 million meals annually.
		<h3>Transportation</h3>
		<p>Because of the many transportation options available,
it is not necessary for your student to have a car while
attending UNT. Students can use UNT Shuttle,
e-ride or Denton County
Transportation Authority services to get around.
Learn more at our <a href="http://unt.edu/transit">transit website</a>.</p>
		<ul>
        <li><a href="http://dcta.net">Denton County Transportation Authority’s (DCTA)</a>
A-train is a 21-mile corridor running from
downtown Denton to Carrollton where passengers
can connect to DART’s Green Line at the Trinity
Mills Station.</li>
		<li>If your student plans to bring a vehicle to campus,
there are several parking permit options available.
The parking fee is not included in tuition and fee
costs. Learn more at <a href="http://unt.edu/transit">our website</a>.</li>
		</ul>
        <h3>Students with disabilities</h3>
		<p>More than 900 students are served through the
<a href="http://disability.unt.edu">Office of Disability Accommodation</a>, which helps
students with hearing, mobility or vision loss;
learning disabilities and brain injuries; cancer;
and other conditions that are not obvious.</p>

<!--
<h3 class="title">Academic support</h3>

<p>Many students are challenged by the rigors of college classes or need to learn how to manage their time for the independent learning required. UNT offers many resources to help students succeed in their college classes. <a href="http://learningcenter.unt.edu/">The Learning Center</a> provides tools for academic success including tutoring, reading labs, study skills labs, speed-reading courses and an extensive academic resource library.</p>
<p>Another invaluable resource for your child is access to computer labs in order to complete coursework. UNT has 14 <a href="http://computerlabs.unt.edu/location-labs">general-access computer labs</a>, including one that is open 24 hours a day and six that have Macintosh computers as well as PCs. All labs offer computer-based training programs, and many offer statistical analysis packages, including SAS, SPSS and SPlus. All residence halls are wired for Internet access, and wireless access is available in most buildings. Three libraries also offer <a href="http://www.library.unt.edu/services/facilities-and-systems/laptops-checkout">free laptop checkout</a>.

<h3>Emotional support</h3>

<p>Good grades aren't everything. The emotional well-being of your child while he or she is away at college is just as important as academic success. Through <a href="http://counselingandtesting.unt.edu/ ">UNT’s Student Counseling Center</a> services, we strive to support students through professional counseling, career counseling, consultation, mental-health screenings, educational programs and self-help resources as well as a referral service. We offer to consult with students, parents, faculty and staff who may be concerned about a UNT student (while still respecting the confidentiality of our clients). With client permission, we often work closely with physicians and psychiatrists, the <a href="http://careercenter.unt.edu/">Career Center</a>, <a href="http://disability.unt.edu">Office of Disability Accommodation</a>, and many other helpful resources in order to provide the best overall care. We value diversity and students can expect to be treated in a respectful and accepting manner.</p>

<h3>Healthcare</h3>

<p>UNT offers a <a href="http://healthcenter.unt.edu">full-service primary care clinic</a>, with full-time physicians, nurse practitioners and nurses to manage your child’s care and treatment. Also offered are a full-service pharmacy, comprehensive lab services, optometry services, radiology services, substance abuse referral service, health education programming and ambulatory mental healthcare provided by part-time senior psychiatric residents. These services are available because students pay a medical usage fee each semester, which is included in their tuition bill. Services are provided at a discount if students need to fill prescriptions or have X-rays taken, laboratory tests performed, nutrition consultation, massage therapy, splints or minor surgery. College Optical Express is the first optical office located on any college campus in the state of Texas. Services are provided at the Student Health and Wellness Center in Chestnut Hall.</p>
<p>All students who are newly enrolled at UNT and who will reside in on-campus housing must provide evidence of vaccination against bacterial meningitis or must qualify for one of the two permissible exemptions prior to moving into on-campus housing. Vaccinations must be administered no fewer than 10 days prior to the student’s move-in date. Exemption will be permitted based on evidence that the vaccine would be injurious to a student’s health based on the professional opinion of a medical practitioner or if the student has refused the vaccination based on a conscientious objection, including religion.</p>
<p>The university recommends that all students have current immunizations for polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, rubella, mumps and measles. Consideration should be given to vaccination against hepatitis A, hepatitis B and varicella.</p>
<p>Most vaccines are available at the Student Health and Wellness Center. Additional information, immunization record and exemption affidavit forms are available online at the <a href="http://healthcenter.unt.edu">Health Center's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Campus Security</h3>

<p>Students can sign up for the <a href="http://www.unt.edu/eaglealert/eagle-alert-parents.htm">Eagle Alert system</a> for information about campus closings and emergency situations affecting the safety and well being of people on and around the campus. Voice and text messages are sent to all students who have provided current contact information. Students should update their contact information at <a href="https://my.unt.edu">my.unt.edu</a>. Please be sure your child signs up for this service.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unt.edu/police/">UNT police</a> patrol the campus 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in vehicles, on bicycles and on foot. At night, the campus is well lighted, and students may ride the night shuttle, request pick up from <a href="http://www.unt.edu/transit/eRide.html">e-ride</a> or call the UNT police for an escort, if needed. More than 70 emergency phones located throughout campus provide direct access to the campus police dispatcher at all times.</p>



<h3>Continued Support</h3>

<p>UNT will continue to support and encourage your child as he or she becomes an upper classman and even after graduation through our job assistance and internship programs.</p>

<p>Internships provide invaluable training and a head start on a career. Most programs offer hands-on experience in your student’s field before graduation. UNT’s nationally accredited <a href="http://studentaffairs.unt.edu/internships">Cooperative Education program</a> provides students with paid, supervised positions related to their field of study, often for several semesters. Some students even receive academic credit for their work and permanent job offers after graduation.</p>

<p>Job placement services are available to help your son or daughter find a full-time job. The <a href="http://careercenter.unt.edu/">Career Center</a> offers one-on-one advising, web-based job listings and on-campus interviews with employers. Dallas- Fort Worth is one of the nation’s top five metropolitan areas for job growth and employment opportunities based on higher than average starting pay, low unemployment and affordable housing. UNT’s well- prepared graduates are recruited by companies like American Airlines, Federal Express, Southwest Airlines and Texas Instruments, among others.</p>
