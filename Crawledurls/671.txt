<div class="long-text">
<b>Go Mean Green! -</b> The University of North Texas asks fans to conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner that reflects well on our teams, our university, and our community. We want to provide all fans with a comfortable, enjoyable, and safe atmosphere. Fans using foul or abusive language or gestures will be removed; fans appearing intoxicated will be removed; and fans interfering with the progress of the game, throwing objects, or going onto the field will be subject to removal, citation, and/or arrest.
<p>
<b>ADA Drop-Off -</b> Fans with disabilities may be dropped off at Apogee Stadium at Gate 1. Vehicles with valid disabled-parking placards or license plates may enter the White Lot near Gate 1 via the entrance on Bonnie Brae St. and drop off fans with disabilities at the entrance of Gate 1. Those vehicles may NOT park in the White Lot unless they have a White Lot Parking Pass. VIOLATORS WILL BE TOWED.
<p>
Those wishing to pick-up fans with disabilities after the game at Gate 1 should plan on delays because you will be going against the flow of traffic. Fans with disabilities should consider taking the courtesy shuttle after the game from the stadium to the ADA parking lot at Fouts Field, and be picked up there.
<p>
<b>ADA Parking -</b> ADA parking is located in the west section of the Fouts Field parking lot. A valid disabled parking placard or license plate is required to park in this area.
<p>
North Texas runs a shuttle service for fans with disabilities from the ADA parking lot to Apogee Stadium beginning four hours prior to kickoff. Before the game, shuttles run from the ADA parking lot to Apogee's Gate 2 and to the Red-Blue lots for tailgating. After the game, shuttles pick up ONLY at Gate 2 and return to the ADA lot. There is no post-game pickup from the tailgating areas.
<p>
The shuttle is designated for those who require assistance and one guest. We ask that those who are able to walk please use the pedestrian bridge from the Fouts parking lot to the stadium and allow those that need assistance the opportunity to use the shuttle.
