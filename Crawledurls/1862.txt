<a name="openrecords" id="openrecords"></a><h2>Open Records Policy</h2>

    <h3>The Public Information Act</h3>
    <p>Texas Government Code, Chapter 552, gives you the right to access  government records; and an officer for public information and the  officer's agent may not ask why you want them. All government  information is presumed to be available to the public. Certain  exceptions may apply to the disclosure of the information. Governmental  bodies shall promptly release requested information that is not  confidential by law, either constitutional, statutory, or by judicial  decision, or information for which an exception to disclosure has not  been sought.</p>
    <h3>Rights of Requestors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Prompt access to information that is not confidential or otherwise protected;</li>
      <li>Receive  treatment equal to all other requestors, including accommodation in  accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements;</li>
      <li>Receive certain kinds of information without exceptions, like the voting record of public officials, and other information;</li>
      <li>Receive  a written statement of estimated charges, when charges will exceed $40,  in advance of work being started and opportunity to modify the request  in response to the itemized statement;</li>
      <li>Choose whether to inspect the requested information (most often at no charge), receive copies of the information or both;</li>
      <li>A  waiver or reduction of charges if the governmental body determines that  access to the information primarily benefits the general public;</li>
      <li>Receive  a copy of the communication from the governmental body asking the  Office of the Attorney General for a ruling on whether the information  can be withheld under one of the accepted exceptions, or if the  communication discloses the requested information, a redacted copy;</li>
      <li>Lodge  a written complaint about overcharges for public information with the  General Services Commission. Complaints of other possible violations  may be filed with the county or district attorney of the county where  the governmental body, other than a state agency, is located. If the  complaint is against the county or district attorney, the complaint  must be filed with the Office of the Attorney General.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Responsibilities of Governmental Bodies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish reasonable procedures for inspecting or copying public information and inform requestors of these procedures;</li>
      <li>Treat all requestors uniformly and shall give to the requestor all  reasonable comfort and facility, including accommodation in accordance  with ADA requirements;</li>
      <li>Be informed about open records laws and educate employees on the requirements of those laws;</li>
      <li>Inform requestors of the estimated charges greater than $40 and any  changes in the estimates above 20 percent of the original estimate, and  confirm that the requestor accepts the charges, or has amended the  request, in writing before finalizing the request;</li>
      <li>Inform the requestor if the information cannot be provided promptly  and set a date and time to provide it within a reasonable time;</li>
      <li>Request a ruling from the Office of the Attorney General regarding  any information the governmental body wishes to withhold, and send a  copy of the request for ruling, or a redacted copy, to the requestor;</li>
      <li>Segregate public information from information that may be withheld and provide that public information promptly;</li>
      <li>Make a good faith attempt to inform third parties when their  proprietary information is being requested from the governmental body;</li>
      <li>Respond in writing to all written communications from the General  Services Commission regarding charges for the information. Respond to  the Office of the Attorney General regarding complaints about  violations of the Act.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Procedures to Obtain Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Submit a request by mail, fax, email or in person according to a governmental body's reasonable procedures.</li>
      <li>Include enough description and detail about the information  requested to enable the governmental body to accurately identify and  locate the information requested.</li>
      <li>Cooperate with the governmental body's reasonable efforts to clarify the type or amount of information requested.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information to be released</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You may review it promptly, and if it cannot be produced within 10  working days the public information officer will notify you in writing  of the reasonable date and time when it will be available.</li>
      <li>Keep all appointments to inspect records and to pick up copies.  Failure to keep appointments may result in losing the opportunity to  inspect the information at the time requested.</li>

    <h3>Information that may be withheld due to an exception</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>By the 10th business day after a governmental body receives your written request, a governmental body must:
        <ol>
            <li>request an Attorney General opinion and state which exceptions apply;</li>
          <li>notify the requestor of the referral to the Attorney General; and</li>
          <li>notify third parties if the request involves their proprietary information.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Failure to request an Attorney General opinion and notify the  requestor within 10 business days will result in a presumption that the  information is open unless there is a compelling reason to withhold it.</li>
      <li>Requestors may send a letter to the Attorney General arguing for  release, and may review arguments made by the governmental body. If the  arguments disclose the requested information, the requestor may obtain  a redacted copy.</li>
      <li>The Attorney General must issue a decision no later than the 45th  working day from the day after the attorney general received the  request for a decision. The attorney general may request an additional  10 working day extension.</li>
