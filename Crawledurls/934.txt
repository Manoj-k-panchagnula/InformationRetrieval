<h3 class="header">Trophy Club Country Club</h3>
<p>Named one of the Best Country Clubs in Dallas-Fort Worth (<i>Avid Golfer</i>, 2011, 2013 and 2014), Trophy Club Country Club is proud to be the home club of legendary LPGA golfer and Golf Hall of Fame Member Kathy Whitworth for more than 20 years. The Club houses the majority of Kathy's trophies, in a beautiful trophy case in the main dining area, from her 88 tour victories, and she still holds the record for the most tour victories by any professional golfer, male or female.</p>
<p>Trophy Club Country Club is home to two world-class golf courses: Ben Hogan's singular golf-course design, a course that places the same demands on a player's accuracy and intellect that Hogan placed on himself; and the Whitworth Course, an equally challenging, modern design.
<p>Trophy Club Country Club recently underwent a renovation that added a new chipping/wedge practice area, an expanded putting area, a renovated landing area with new target fairway and greens, and an expanded single-level hitting deck.</p>
