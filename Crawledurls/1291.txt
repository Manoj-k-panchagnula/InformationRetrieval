        <p>About 10 years ago, <a href="http://engineering.unt.edu/technology/people/phillip-foster"><strong>Phil Foster</strong></a> was on Galveston Island watching gas-powered cars drive back and forth along Seawall Boulevard.
“I thought how progressive it would be to see gasoline-electric hybrid cars driving there instead,” says Foster, associate professor
and coordinator of <a href="http://engineering.unt.edu/technology/">mechanical engineering technology</a> in the University of North Texas <a href="http://engineering.unt.edu"><strong>College of Engineering</strong></a><strong>.</strong> “Better yet, what if the
cars didn’t rely on gasoline to be recharged? Hybrid cars that wouldn’t pollute the air with emissions from burning fossil fuels?”</p>
        
        <div class="caption_box_rt" style=""> <img src="images/2014_feature_college-of-innovation_1.jpg" alt="Phil Foster" class="photo_bot" style="border-color: #D0A22A;"/>
        
        <p><strong>Phil Foster</strong>, associate professor and coordinator of mechanical engineering technology, earned a patent for his liquid-cooled Stirling engine with an energy-saving segmented rotary displacer. He continues to test the environmentally friendly engine, which converts heat energy into mechanical power.</p><p class="photo-by">Photo by: Michael Clements</p>
        
        </div>
        
        <p>Soon after, Foster began sketching out design concepts and fabricating parts in the engineering technology machine shop, ultimately
creating the first ever liquid-cooled Stirling engine with a segmented rotary displacer. Stirling engines convert heat energy
into mechanical power, rather than drawing power from the combustion of fossil fuels or from the power grid, which is itself heavily
reliant on fossil fuels. In 2013, Foster was granted a patent for his invention, which is unique among Stirling engines in that it has
only three moving parts, including the rotary displacer. This displacer consumes less energy than the reciprocating displacers found in
traditional Stirling designs, he says.</p>
        
        <p>"Stirling engines take heat energy from a difference in temperatures and, using a generator, turn that energy into electricity,” Foster
says. “They are very efficient and quiet and use environmentally friendly energy sources, many of which are incompatible with internal
combustion engines. They may hold the promise of replacing other engines, perhaps even smaller internal combustion engines.”</p>
        
        <p>Research supporting sustainability is one of the hallmarks of UNT’s College of Engineering, which was formed by joining the engineering
technology, computer science and materials science programs in 2003. Since its founding, the college has more than doubled its
undergraduate and master’s enrollments, more than doubled its research award funding and nearly quadrupled its doctoral enrollments.</p>

<p>Located at UNT’s <strong>Discovery Park</strong> campus, a 300-acre research park in north Denton, the college added electrical engineering in
2005, and the combined mechanical and energy engineering program became the first of its kind in the nation in 2006. This year, the
college marks the addition of <a href="http://engineering.unt.edu/departments/biomedical-engineering">biomedical engineering</a>, the engineering field that is expected to become the fastest growing in the country
over the next decade. The program will focus on biomedical instrumentation, mechanics and informatics.</p>

<p>“A great advantage of being a young, modern college is that we have the newest technologies available to researchers,” says Dean
  <strong>Costas Tsatsoulis.</strong> “This is great for faculty, but also for students, who graduate ready to use the industry’s most up-to-date equipment.”</p>
<p>Students also have the advantage of
working with outstanding faculty researchers,
who are developing new technologies
and real-world solutions in multiple fields.</p>

<h2>Sustainable Energy Technology</h2>
<div class="caption_box_rt" style=""> <img src="images/2014_feature_college-of-innovation_3.jpg" alt="Yong Tao" class="photo_top" style="border-color: #A4784B;"/>
        
        <p><strong>Yong Tao</strong>, Distinguished Research Professor, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering and director of the PACCAR Technology
Institute, directs UNT’s Zero Energy Laboratory. He is identifying gaps in sustainability knowledge with a National Science Foundation grant.</p><p class="photo-by">Photo by: Michael Clements</p>
        
        </div>
<p>At UNT’s <a href="https://engineering.unt.edu/mechanicalandenergy/zero-energy-research-lab"><strong>Zero Energy Laboratory</strong></a> — the only lab of its kind in Texas —
director <a href="https://engineering.unt.edu/mechanicalandenergy/dr-yong-tao"><strong>Yong Tao</strong></a> and his students focus
on improving the environment as they
work with the latest sustainable energy
technologies and monitor how people use
energy in their everyday lives. The lab,
which opened in 2012, is a testing ground
for solar and wind power systems, energy-efficient
windows, sustainable building
materials and energy monitoring systems.</p>

        
        <p>Over the lab’s first year, Tao — a
Distinguished Research Professor and
chair of the <a href="https://engineering.unt.edu/mechanicalandenergy/">mechanical and energy engineering department</a> who also directs the
<strong>PACCAR Technology Institute</strong> at UNT
— worked to understand how humans use
energy and what factors affect that use.
The facility contains a working
laboratory space and a test living area.
Research participants visit the living area
and use its kitchen, bathroom and bedroom
space the way they would in their
own homes. From the laboratory space,
Tao and his students monitor the water
and energy use data.</p>
<p>“Having data on how real people use
real technology is important because, right
now, most builders use simulation software
to understand how energy is used in
a home,” Tao says. “If we understand how
humans use energy and use technology, we
can design better appliances, materials and
power sources in the future.”</p>

<p>Tao found that the cultural and
geographic backgrounds of building occupants
greatly impact their use of energy.
For example, compared to China, the
United States consumes more than five
times the energy per capita.</p>
<p>
“We also found that an occupant’s
behavior is influenced by sociocultural environment,
technology innovation, building
design and local climate,” Tao says.</p>

<p>
He received a $653,000 National
Science Foundation grant, part of the
NSF’s Research Coordination Networks
— Science, Engineering and Education for
Sustainability program, to identify gaps in
sustainability knowledge.</p>
<p>
Tao will bring together researchers
with backgrounds in engineering,
construction, computer science, environmental
science, business, architecture
and social science to share data and fill in
knowledge gaps.</p>
<p>
“Uncertainty in human behavior —
or why people use energy the way they
do — can affect energy consumption by
40 to 60 percent,” Tao says. “We can
design energy-efficient buildings and create
new technologies, but without a strong
understanding of these issues in human
behavior, as well as government policy and
business, those technologies won’t be put
to their best use.”</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <h2>Emergency Response</h2>
        
        <p>In UNT’s <a href="http://cerl.unt.edu/"><strong>Center for Computational Epidemiology and Response Analysis</strong></a><strong>,</strong> researchers are monitoring technology of
a different kind. Simulated disease outbreaks
spread across the center’s maps and
display screens, helping faculty and students
better understand how to respond
to and plan for emergencies.</p>
<p>
<strong>Armin Mikler,</strong> professor of computer
science and director of the center, received
an $800,000 grant from the National
Institutes of Health to work with other
UNT and UNT Health Science Center
researchers on the Response Plan
Analyzer, or RE-PLAN. The computer-based
system will help emergency planners identify vulnerable populations —
for example, residents who have
no access to vehicles during an
evacuation or are unable to leave
their homes due to health problems
— and modify response plans
accordingly.</p>
<p>
“The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention mandates
that all counties prepare for adverse
events, and our RE-PLAN system
can serve as a very useful interface
for identifying problem areas and
better preparing for emergencies,”
Mikler says.</p>
<p>
Mark Fulmer is the preparedness
planner for Tarrant County
Public Health, which is working
with the researchers on the project.
He says the system offers a variety
of interactive tools to help planners
prepare for different scenarios,
such as major highways becoming
inaccessible and requiring the
rerouting of resources.</p>
<p>
“Plans are most successful
when plenty of data is available for
research and testing,” Fulmer says.
“The RE-PLAN system’s benefits
really boil down to it being a strong
source of information we can use
to evaluate and test plans, which is
essential before any incident actually
occurs.”</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <h2>Social Media Searches</h2>
        <div class="caption_box_rt" style=""> <img src="images/2014_feature_college-of-innovation_2.jpg" alt="Yan Huang" class="photo_bot" style="border-color: #50B1BA;"/>
        
        <p><strong>Yan Huang</strong>, associate professor of computer science, is researching a location-based search function for social media, funded by the U.S. Department of 
Defense.</p><p class="photo-by">Photo by:Michael Clements</p>
        
        </div>
        
        <p>Down the hallway, computer
science associate professor <a href="https://faculty.unt.edu/editprofile.php?pid=1967"><strong>Yan Huang</strong></a> also is working on new
technology that could prove helpful
in emergencies — in this instance,
through social media.</p>
<p>
She is developing a location-based
search function that will
allow users of social media platforms
to search for and find more
information than ever before.
On many social platforms today,
users search for an event, such as
a natural disaster, using keywords
— for example “Earthquake in
Los Angeles.” The problem with
keyword-based searches is that only
social media updates and pages with
those exact words will be found.</p>
<p>
Funded by a U.S. Department
of Defense grant, Huang is developing
a model for detecting events
that incorporates check-in data, text
data and hometown location from
users’ social profiles. The model will
predict user locations using postings
and locations referenced in text
on social platforms, and will rely
heavily on how people connect and
interact with each other on social
networks. The work will be tested
on data publicly available such as
Twitter and Gowalla. She is working
with Rada Mihalcea, former
UNT associate professor now at the
University of Michigan.</p>
<p>
“A tremendous amount of
information is being shared every
day on social platforms, including
information that is valuable to
others, such as events, gatherings
or natural disaster occurrences,”
Huang says.</p>
<p>
“With this algorithm, a user
will be able to search for events, and
results will include tweets or other
social updates that may not explicitly
mention a location.”</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>Across departments, College
of Engineering faculty are researching
ways to improve health and
save lives. <strong><a href="http://engineering.unt.edu/materials/dr-narendra-dahotre">Narendra Dahotre</a>,</strong> Distinguished
Research Professor
of materials science and engineering
— and newly named fellow
of the National Academy of
Inventors — has filed a patent on
a new laser technology he and his research associate at the Indian Institute
of Technology-Madras developed for
cutting and shaping bone. It causes
minimal damage, could speed up surgery
and recovery times, and could lessen the
amount of blood lost during operations.</p>

<p>
“This laser technique is a revolutionary
tool, and could replace many of
the conventional metal tools that cause
so much excess damage during surgery,”
says Dahotre, who has researched laser
technologies for nearly two and half
decades. “The technique we developed
allows for precise interaction of the laser
beam with the matter it is cutting.”</p><div class="box-right">
<h2>Friction
Stir Processing</h2>
<div class="caption_box_rt" style="padding:0;"> <img src="images/2014_feature_friction-stir_1.jpg" alt="Friction Stir Processing" class="photo_top" style="border-color: #008066;"/>
        
        <p>A new custom-designed lab houses the UNT site of the Center for Friction Stir Processing.</p><p class="photo-by">Photo by: Jonathan Reynolds</p>
        
        </div>
<p><strong>Rajiv Mishra</strong>’s <strong>Center for Friction
Stir Processing</strong> came to UNT in 2011.
Mishra, professor of materials science
and engineering, brought the center to
UNT’s College of Engineering because
of its faculty expertise and connections
to industry partners.</p>
<p>
The lab is part of a National
Science Foundation-funded Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center working to improve the performance
of alloys through friction stir
processing, an emerging technique for
joining solid-state metals.</p>
<p>
The process is environmentally
friendly, energy efficient and versatile,
and is of growing interest to corporations
and industry partners including
Boeing, General Motors, the Army
Research Laboratory, Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory and more.</p>
<p>
In fall 2013, the College of
Engineering custom-designed a $2
million lab space at UNT’s Discovery
Park campus for the center. The
2,700-square-foot lab features specially
designed workspaces for post-doctoral
and graduate students and an
equipment layout ideal for friction stir
processing research.</p>
<p>
“Often, researchers have to
adapt or grow into their lab spaces,
but we were able to customize this
space so it flows ideally for our
research needs,” Mishra says. “We
have high-quality friction stir machinery
and materials characterization
machines, including a laser welding
machine provided by the U.S. Army
Research Office.”</p>
<p>
The lab also features a number
of solid-state joining machines, a friction
stir spot welding machine provided
by General Motors and an ultrasonic
spot welding machine. The diverse
equipment is a draw for potential
industry and research partners.</p>
<p>
Mishra works alongside university
partners Brigham Young University,
University of South Carolina,
South Dakota School of Mines
and Technology, and Wichita State
University to conduct research for
industry through the I/UCRC.</p>
</div>
<p>
Dahotre says the technology would
be ideal for such procedures as joint
replacements, bone grafts, limb salvaging
and removal of cancerous segments of
bone. He also plans to develop a robotic
system that would allow surgeons to
operate remotely using computer controls
for automation and precision.</p>

<p>
The group is working with a

Science Center and a physician from
the Baylor University Medical Center
to develop lightweight conductive fabric
with sensors that can detect, amplify and
interpret EKG data to determine if an
athlete is experiencing cardiac-related
abnormalities during sports events.</p>
<p>
“This fabric would alert athletes,
emergency personnel and others to
potential cases of sudden cardiac arrest,”
Mehta says. “If we can detect early signs,
we are one step closer to preventing
casualties.”</p>

        
        <h2>Robots and Health</h2>
        
       
        <p>Focusing on the area of mental
health, <a href="https://faculty.unt.edu/editprofile.php?pid=3906&onlyview=1"><strong>Rodney Nielsen</strong></a>, associate professor
of computer science and engineering,
is developing a companion robot
that aims to help senior citizens overcome
depression.</p>
<p>
Nielsen’s Companionbot, the size
of a large stuffed animal, would stay in
a person’s home, monitor actions and
language for signs of depression and
intervene. The Companionbot focuses
on dialogue, generating and answering
questions, and monitoring participants
for signs of physical, mental or emotional
deterioration.</p>
<p>
“If a person dropped a glass of
water and said, ‘I do this all the time,
this is all my fault,’” Nielsen says, “the
Companionbot would respond with
encouraging information and questions
to get the participant to move the focus
away from negativity.”</p>
<p>
Nielsen’s project is funded by a nearly
$2 million grant from the National Science
Foundation. He is working with researchers
from the University of Colorado
Denver’s Anschutz Medical Campus, the
University of Denver and Boulder
Language Technologies on the project.</p>
<p>
Opportunities for conducting
research in the health field will increase
as the College of Engineering opens
its new <strong>Department of Biomedical
Engineering.</strong> Students will be able to collaborate
with faculty at the UNT Health
Science Center and learn from experts.</p>
<p>
“Our program will be unique in that
students will develop a strong base of
engineering fundamentals while working
with faculty who are well known in
industry and academia for their work in
the biomedical field,” Tsatsoulis says.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2>Real-world Solutions</h2>
        
        <p>The link to industry is strong in
the college, where the emphasis is on
research that offers solutions for real-world
issues. For example, <a href="http://engineering.unt.edu/technology/people/haifeng-zhang"><strong>HaifengZhang</strong></a>, assistant professor of engineering
technology, is teaming up with
industry professionals and Stony Brook
University to create a new self-powered
temperature and pressure sensor that can
operate underground and withstand the
stresses of oil and gas drilling.</p>
<p>
His research is funded by a Grant
Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) grant through
the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>
“Developing this new sensor is very
exciting,” Zhang says. “It will need to
withstand the harsh, high-temperature
environment of drilling a few hundred
meters below the earth’s surface. Very few
sensors on the market could survive that.”</p>
<p>Real-world problems also are the
focus for seniors in the college, who are
required to take a two-semester capstone
course to apply the information and skills
they’ve learned in a group research project.</p>
<p>
A design by <strong>Adam Marlowe, Bryan
Cotanch</strong> and <strong>James Parker</strong> has become
the first undergraduate project in UNT
history to earn a patent. The three engineering
technology students, who graduated
in 2009, created a brake system
that signals brake lights to turn on when
a vehicle slows down, even if the driver
hasn’t touched the brake pedal.</p>
<p>
Cotanch is now an electronics
technician with the Federal Aviation
Administration, and Marlowe is a systems
integration engineer at L3 communications.</p>
<p>
“Getting a patent on the design was
huge for me,” Marlowe says. “It’s the
No. 1 bullet under ‘accomplishments’
on my resume.”</p>
<p>
Foster, who continues work on his
patented Stirling engine, teaches machining
and senior design courses in the engineering
technology department and has
helped hundreds of students with their
projects since he joined UNT in 1982.</p>
<p>
He also has seen firsthand the conception,
birth and growth of the College
of Engineering. While programs and
enrollments have expanded, he says one
thing has been constant.</p>
<p>
“The entire engineering faculty
remains committed to helping students
acquire the education and research
experiences essential to success when
they graduate and enter into engineering
careers around the world.”</p>

and Engineering is one of the oldest in the country,
celebrating more than 40 years of excellence. </li>

<li>The college is the headquarters for the <strong>Net-Centric Software and Systems Center,</strong> a
National Science Foundation Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center based at UNT, and
is home to sites for two other I/UCRCs — the
  <strong>Center for Friction Stir Processing</strong> and the <strong>Center
for Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural Alloys.</strong></li>
<li>The PACCAR Technology Institute at Discovery
Park, funded by a $1.5 million donation from the
PACCAR foundation, supports research related to
alternative energy, energy efficiency and industrial
processes.
</li>
<li>Outstanding faculty and graduate students publish
their research in respected international journals.
Since the college’s founding in 2003, faculty
members have nearly quadrupled the amount of
published research from the college.
</li>
<li>The college is a major contributor to industry in
the North Texas region and beyond, graduating
more than 2,500 engineers since its founding.
</li>
<li>UNT’s history in technology education dates
to the turn of the 20th century when courses
in subjects such as joinery and mechanical
drawing were first offered. The Department of
Engineering Technology evolved from the university’s
longtime program in industrial technology
and industrial arts.</li></ul>
