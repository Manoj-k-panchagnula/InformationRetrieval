			<h2>Web Privacy Statement</h2>
      
      <p>The administrators of ApplyTexas are committed to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of your confidential information. We do not actively share personal information gathered from our Web servers.
        However, because <a href="https://www.applytexas.org">www.applytexas.org</a>
        is administered by a state agency, some information collected from the
        ApplyTexas Web site, including the summary server log information,
        e-mails sent to the Web site, and information collected from Web-based
        forms, may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act. This means
        that while we do not actively share information, in some cases we may
        be compelled by law to release information gathered from our Web servers.</p>
      <p>As part of our commitment to maintain the privacy of our Web users, the <a href="http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/index.cfm?objectid=A705EC74-EE7C-E0CD-53EEE0BBCF66B602">Texas
        Higher Education Coordinating Board</a> has developed this privacy statement. The statement has two purposes:</p>
      
      <div id="informational">
      <ol>
        <li>To educate users about privacy issues</li>
        <li>To inform users about specific privacy policies and guidelines employed by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board</li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      
      <p>Texas public universities also comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education records without student permission. For more details on FERPA, currently enrolled students should see the University's General Information Catalog. </p>
        
      <p>ApplyTexas contains links to several external Web sites. The administrators of ApplyTexas are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the external Web sites to which we link.</p>
        
      <h3>Information We Gather</h3>
      <p>Our Web servers generate temporary logs that contain the following information:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Internet address of computer being used</li>
        <li>Web pages requested</li>
        <li>Referring Web page</li>
        <li>Browser used</li>
        <li>Date and Time</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The data are used in aggregate by system administrators and Web content managers to tune the Web site for its efficiency and is not ordinarily associated
      with specific individuals. Raw data from the Web server logs is only shared with the content manager of the Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help Web publishers determine what Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show a particular Web page is very popular or used more by freshmen than by seniors, we use this information
      to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.</p>
      
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages you have visited. For example, when you visit some sites on the Web you might see a &quot;Welcome Back&quot; message. The first time you visited the site a cookie was probably set on your computer; when you return, the cookie is read again. You can
        refuse to accept cookies, can disable cookies, and remove cookies from
        your hard drive. In Netscape Navigator, choose Edit and Preferences to
        manage your cookie settings, in Internet Explorer select Tools and Internet Options.</p>
        
      <p>It is against Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board policy to share cookie information with external third parties.</p>
      
      <h3>Security and Accuracy of Confidential Information</h3>
      <p>The administrators of ApplyTexas do their best to ensure that the personal information obtained from you is accurate. You may review the information provided on any application saved or submitted via this web site at any time up to the point when the application is purged from the database.</p>
      
      <p>Although no computer system is 100% secure, the administrators of ApplyTexas have deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under their control. Certified independent security specialists audit these security measures and respective systems.</p>
        
      <p>Notification of Rights under Texas Law: Information collected about you
      through this application may be held by any institution of higher education 
      to which you apply. With few exceptions, you are entitled on your request 
      to be informed about the collected information. Under Sections 552.021 and 
      552.023 of the Texas Government Code, you are entitled to receive and review 
      the information. Under section 559.004 of the Texas Government Code, you are 
      entitled to correct information held by an institution that is incorrect. 
      You may correct information held by any institution to which you apply by 
      contacting the institution. The information that is collected about you will 
      be retained and maintained as required by Texas records retention laws 
      (Section 441.180 et seq. of the Texas Government Code) and rules. Different 
      types of information are kept for different periods of time.   The Texas
      Higher Education Coordinating Board, or its authorized representative(s), 
      has permission to contact you regarding your ApplyTexas application and/or 
      regarding related educational outreach purposes (including, for example, 
      to make you aware of financial aid opportunities) using any of the contact 
      information for communication methods (email, mail, phone, cellular, text 
      message, or automated telephone dialing equipment).  Your information will 
      not be sold for commercial purposes.  </p>
        
      <h3>E-commerce</h3>
      <p>If allowed by the institution to which you are applying, ApplyTexas enables you to pay for application fees with a credit card.  It is Texas Higher Education Coordinating
        Board policy that confidential information you enter in the transaction
        is used only for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an
        additional use is specifically stated on that site.</p>
        
      <h3>Sharing of Information</h3>
      <p>The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board does not, unless upon explicit request of institutional users, share information with other parties or
        gather information from other private data providers. Unless specifically
        required under public information requests filed under the Texas Public
        Information Act, it is against Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board
        policy to release confidential information gathered through the Web, such
        as pages visited, or personalized preferences. </p>
      <p>Consistent with FERPA, the administrators of ApplyTexas do not release personal student information to other parties unless they receive explicit written authorization to do so. </p>
      
      <h3>Open Records Requests</h3>
      <p>Except for educational records governed by FERPA, all information collected via the ApplyTexas web site, including the summary server log information, e-mails sent to the Web site, and information collected from Web-based forms, may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act.</p>
      
      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>If you have questions about this privacy statement or you believe that your personal information has been released without your consent send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:applytexas@austin.utexas.edu">the ApplyTexas Help Desk</a>.
