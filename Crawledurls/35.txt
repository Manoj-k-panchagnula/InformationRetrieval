<p>Chen’s winning design,
which received the Cotton

Design Award, was influenced
by the origami principle
of folding to prevent
fabric waste.</p>

G. Brandfonbrener Young
Investigator Award at the
Performing Arts Medicine
Association’s annual symposium
in 2013 for her research
on health issues of marching
band musicians. She is the
first undergraduate student
from the United States and
the first non-medical student
to win the award.</p>
<p>Working with faculty
mentor <a href="https://music.unt.edu/faculty-and-staff/detail/17"><strong>Kris Chesky</strong></a><strong>,</strong> director
of education and research
for UNT’s Texas Center for
Music and Medicine, she
conducted an epidemiological
survey of marching band
members to investigate the
impact of marching band
on participants’ health and
which members are most
prone to experience pain.</p>
<p>She found that the music
majors in the marching
band experience more pain
and injuries, due to longer
hours of daily music-making,
than the non-music majors.
Her research was published
in the <em>Medical Problems of
Performing Artists</em> journal.</p>

<p>In her work with <a href="http://geography.unt.edu/faculty/joseph-oppong"><strong>Joseph Oppong</strong></a><strong>,</strong> professor of geography,
she uses geographic
information systems to
determine areas underserved
by mental health services,
particularly for the homeless,

<p>She is evaluating a proposed
scattered supportive
housing initiative to house
2,000 chronically homeless
people in Houston. The
model she is creating for
locating new mental health
facilities, which also can be
applied in Dallas-Fort Worth

help agencies use available
funding for mental healthcare
in Texas more efficiently.</p>
