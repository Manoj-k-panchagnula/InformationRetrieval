  <h2 align="left"> Bill J. Priest Center <strong><br />
  for Community College Education: </strong>Its Purpose and Benefactors</h2>
  <p>Established to prepare leaders and teachers for specific careers in community colleges, the Bill J. Priest Center is unique in the field.&nbsp; Higher Education programs around the country typically include a course or two on community college issues, but few offer a comprehensive education designed specifically to prepare those pursuing careers in community colleges.&nbsp; Because of the Priest Center, the University of North Texas Program in Higher Education is able to offer a Doctorate in Higher Education with a specialization in Community College Education.&nbsp; Students completing this program are highly marketable for community college positions.</p>

    </ul>
  <h3><a name="first" id="first">Bill J. Priest </a>Center History</h3>
  <p>The Center was named in honor of Dr. Bill J. Priest, the founding Chancellor of the Dallas County Community College District and the inspiration for the Bill J. Priest Center at UNT. Dr. Priest, former Chancellor of the Dallas County Community College District, served from 1965 to 1981. He is credited with building the community college system in Dallas. Today, the DCCCD is comprised of seven different college campuses throughout Dallas County. Additionally, the DCCCD operates the Bill J. Priest Campus of El Centro College , the R. Jan LeCroy Center for Educational Telecommunications, and various centers across Dallas County.</p>
  <p> In addition to being the founding chancellor of DCCCD, Dr. Priest held a leadership position in a number of national community college initiatives including the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Helping to found the League for Innovation in the Community College</li>
  <li>President of the American Association of Community Colleges</li>
  <li>Chairman of the American Council on Education</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The American Association of Junior Colleges is now AACC (American Association of Community Colleges), the leading community college association in the nation. It provides a convention each year that attracts thousands of community college presidents, board members, and administrators nationally.</p>
  <p>The League for Innovation has grown tremendously over the years and provides leadership and renewal opportunities for community college administrators and faculty through a variety of programs and conferences. The American Council on Education, which Dr. Priest chaired, was founded in 1918 and today provides leadership on higher educational issues nationally and influences public policy through advocacy, research, and program initiatives.</p>
  <p>Although the community college was a major part of Dr. Priest's life, he also has had a lifelong love of baseball. He played professional baseball (a pitcher) and was inducted into the Athletic Hall of Fame at the University of California at Berkeley. Additionally, he served his country as an intelligence officer for the United States Navy in the Philippines and postwar Japan.</p>
  <p>He is a man loved and respected by people nationally who have benefited from his commitment to the community college movement and to the students the community college serves.</p>
